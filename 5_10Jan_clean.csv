For my ICLN friends

 

The most established ETF to play this trend is the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF          [ICLN,](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ICLN?mod=MW_story_quote)which covers companies in every geography and in every segment of  alternative energy and boasts almost $5 billion in assets. Perhaps most  important, while it does have some plays with vague EV applications,  such as hydrogen fuel cell stock Plug Power          [PLUG,](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PLUG?mod=MW_story_quote)it is indeed a play on alternative energy — unlike the some funds, like the Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF         [PBW](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PBW?mod=MW_story_quote)that roughly tripled last year thanks to boasting Nio          [NIO](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/NIO?mod=MW_story_quote)as a top holding.

If you want to play EVs, there are  plenty of ways to do that. But this iShares ETF is a broader play on  green energy that could do very well in 2021.

1610255109,350,0,FALSE,1610255120,1,"The question asked (like many of you have DM’ed me about):

Do you think a steel crash is coming?

My response:

I could give you another DD on micro and macroeconomics and explain exactly why we are not even near a crash. 

For a crash to happen, there would need to be a nuclear bomb to take us all off the map. 

Then in a billion years when whoever is rebuilding the world, I’d be bullish on steel. 

Long story, short - when the MULTI-TRILLION US infrastructure drops and the rest of the world follows (and some already have - like China) anyone that is making steel will be printing faster than J-Powell. 

I haven’t even gotten into the LUCRATIVE nature of government contracts some of these US steel manufacturers will get. Remember in the 80’s when the US government was building and paying $400 for toilet seats?  They will come up with projects and contracts with mills to supply steel. 

There will be a short supply and US businesses will be looking for import material that will come from the largest steel maker in the world - $MT.  Well positioned in Canada and Mexico. 

Oh, and I’m just giving you the US situation. 

Imagine the same around the globe in all developed nations. 

Not a lot of people realize that government is big business - the biggest when they want to be.  

Throw all the global tension in there as well with all major country’s expanding their military’s - do you know how much steel goes into building naval vessels?  Tanks?  This is why there was a section 232 enacted - steel production is necessary for our safety and self-defense.  Lastly, I once sold steel as part of a nuclear reactor project.  Do you know how many truckloads of steel alone went into the building of one nuclear reactor?  1,600 - 24 ton trucks. 40,000T. To build one aircraft carrier?  60,000T.  

Check this out:  https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2442969/statement-from-deputy-secretary-of-defense-david-l-norquist-on-the-department-o/

Wanted to share as a lot of you keep asking. 

I’m bullish on steel. 

My first post said this was a short term play - to trade out in 6 months or when steel prices go sideways for 60 days straight. 

I’m starting to believe this is a LONGER TERM PLAY. 

I’m pushing out to August at this point.  

Based on what Biden announces and will get passed - this may be a 2021 play into 2022. 

Don’t get crazy yet.  

Wait for the Vito blessing. 

Hope Saturday night has been good.  

More NFL tomorrow - bet the STEELERS TO COVER. 

They win by 25 - guessing that will also be the price of $CMC after earnings pre-market.

China is more advanced than the average American thinks, but it DOES NOT have the ability to convert to electric anytime soon. Their major cities are impressive, but travel outside of them or to rural parts and there's unstable infrastructure (particularly electric), China becomes third world.

This is important because electric cars will be nothing but a luxury item for rich people to buy in major cities, and not something the average person will want, or even be able to use effectively, if they live in the 90% of China which isn't a major city. It would be IMPOSSIBLE to build or maintain something like Tesla's impressive super charger network in China. Too much of it is rural

Whereas in America, it's possible. In Canada and western European countries? It's possible. I've owned a Tesla for 2 years in SoCal and taken a few long distance road trips on it... and the super charger network is fucking amazing. You can trust it, and you get the impression that America can convert to 100% electric within 20 years, whereas China could reach America's CURRENT level of usage in maybe 25 years. There are just too many hurdles for China to become majority electric anytime soon.

Tesla knows how to do it, they've taken over the entire American market for EV and there is no competitor in sight. Dinosaur companies like Ford and Honda operate on short term profits. If they can make more in the short term squeezing the last amount of profit out of the gasoline era, they will do it instead of losing profit to convert their existing infrastructure. Therefore Tesla will continue to dominate with no real challenger in sight for at least the next decade.

Tesla's real moon mission will be as it continues to absorb the entire EV market in the west as the west simultaneously passes sweeping legislation to force EV usages and ban gasoline vehicles... like what california (6th largest economy in the world) is doing by 2030. Elon will be like a fatass hippo with his mouth wide open, gobbling up EV market share that the western governments forcefully create. Perfect travel conditions for a decade long moon mission, I'd say.

Basically, no one wants to own a NIO. Even if it isn't just a cheap chinese knockoff, it feels like that. People want Tesla, governments are forcing pro EV laws whether people want them or not (yellow vest strikes in France), and there's nothing those yellow vest peasants can do about it except buy TSLA and not be peasants anymore by 2030.

China may gap up faster than I think, but the entire west will be 100% EV before China is even 30% EV, so Tesla is the way to go.

Now that we have the pleasantries out the way; what you ppl do not understand is that the recent continuation of $TSLA's mooning has nothing to do with its technical analysis or news cycle. The $TSLA diamond handers and FOMO boomers have driven the price up so hard since inclusion to the $SPY that benchmark funds and even some major funds have yet to balance their ports and are still in process of doing so.  

Im not gonna act like Im a fkn ETF's and index savant so correct my retard interpretation if I'm wrong but from what I do know--is that $TSLA is going up so hard that its already weighted at 2% in $SPY. Thus, if these benchmark funds aren't in $TSLA or properly balanced w/ $TSLA then you're essentially short $TSLA. Thus, price will continue to rise till equilibrium is achieved in the funds--allegedly. For the 5 of you that can read, the source is a twitter thread discussing these topics. 

So will $TSLA have a doomsday drop as you paper-handed bitches claim? Maybe. But that can be attributed to almost any stock that meme'd in 2020. The take-away is that $TSLA is still serving tendies, and I'm definitely still in that mufuckin' line. I couldn't give a fuck about the constant fluidity of the inner workings of corporations and ETFs and shit, so if any of you autist boomers can add any insight if you aren't sleep already at 11pm on a Saturday night, go ahead.

Wendy's filed for chapter 11 protection back in July. Since then the news has come out that something to the tune of 925 pizza huts and 225 Wendy's locations are being sold to Flynn restaurant group. Since Flynn is the largest franchisee in the states I am willing to bet they have some pretty radical and expensive plans on how to improve the stores they bought. Given that their other franchises include Panera, Taco Bell, and Applebees, it's a fair assumption that these stores will get the full treatment.

These little nuggets of joy caused the fast food juggernaut that is Wendy's to boost sales 4.4% in same store YOY, and according to the CEO that was largely in part to the spicy chicken nugget. Over the last year the company has been focusing on beefing up (pun intended) the value menu, and boy did they. I just got back from some exhaustive research. I spent $20 on only value menu items and brought back a total of 17.6 LBS of food!!! I did the same thing at McDonald's (13.2 Lbs.) and  Burger King (15.1 Lbs) and Wendy's is the clear victor. This is relevant because as we all know the restaurant industry is cut throat and at some point when everyone is eating the same slop, the game becomes who has the most slop for the cheapest price. WENDY'S IS THAT SLOP.

The sheer poundage aside, Wendy's is a solid company that now has more money being thrown at a large number of stores. This has created an opportunity. With a large amount of mom and pop stores closing, restaurant choices are becoming slimmer and slimmer. On top of that, Wendy's is set to expand their international presence to 1500 stores and anticipates doubling it's sales to 2bn by 2024. I think they're underselling it. I think it's a 2bn company NOW that hasn't been discovered by the real market makers, the people in this sub. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

I purchased early on Friday because I've had a few stocks that didn't act as I expected them to during hype days like Nio Day, and I wanted to be prepared in case it fell off a cliff early on Monday.

Spoiler alert: By 2010 both S&amp;P and TSX had gained significantly from their bottom but were still shy of pre-recession levels. In 2010 there was talk of overvaluation in certain sectors, but still positivity in the news. This continued until 2011, where the aforementioned Debt Crisis “hiccuped” the market. Fear and uncertainty persisted into 2012, but the market continued pushing forward. It is mainly in 2013 where we start to see more talk and certainty about bubbles. Contrast this to today, where the talk of bubbles has come not even one year post-bear market of Spring 2020.

What does this prove? Well, nothing really. But it gives us some insight into markets and narratives.

The debt crisis was felt two years after the big stimulus packages, while investors were cautiously optimistic about the markets. But there was still a lot of negative sentiment the whole way through.

The market was clearly labelled a bubble by 2013 and heading into 2014, but that never came to fruition. Markets definitely ""frothed"" in 2016 onwards. What we saw in March 2020 was an unprecedented level of global stimulus, which has and will continue to have an upward effect on asset prices.

Is it a bubble? Well, seems like people felt the stock market was in one or heading towards one in 2013/14.

A more likely possibility is the Debt Crisis pt.2, so stay tuned for that.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ku4tl1/a_media_analysis_from_20102013_on_stimulus_debt/,,1/10/2021,1:56:20,8:56:20 PM,20:56:20

Had a near $2,000 bull run from March 2020 at a price of $1,600 to $3,550 in September. Huge symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart signaling another move of the same kind. 

If we can get a similar move, that'd put Amazon over $5,000 by around August. I'm INSANELY bullish on AMZN. I'm currently swinging options expiring in 2 weeks, but I'd like to sell to buy an expiration much further out. Bought yesterday on the dip to $3,140.

I made a post on Tuesday morning about $WISH, and since then, the share price rose from about $18.80 to $21.58 (up nearly 15%), and then dipped back down to $20.36 on Friday. The post where I explain why I believe Wish.com is undervalued can be viewed here: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqv48d/why_wish_has_the_potential_to_go_to_the_moon_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

There are a few highly influential events that I believe will happen soon, and I’m gonna try to explain why I think Wish.com is the perfect play to navigate the next few months and beyond. 

1. With the house, senate, and presidency going democrat, I believe that additional stimulus, if not passed very soon, will be in the news non-stop. Even if it doesn’t pass right away, this simply means there is more time to play the hype. 
2. I believe that data will come out showing that not enough people are being vaccinated and/or too many people will refuse to become vaccinated. This can create uncertainty about extended stay-at-home orders and/or delays in getting back to a normal way of life.
3. I believe there will be uncertainty around increases in taxes for big companies. 

In reference to point 3, I believe Wish’s share price is so undervalued that it can weather any overall market volatility caused by news of attempts to increase corporate taxes. As an e-commerce company, it is a no-brainer that wish.com will benefit from additional stimulus and extended lockdowns. 

On top of this, WISH is yet to release their first earnings report post-IPO, and the quiet period before analysts start setting price targets will be over in about 2 weeks. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Bank of America did the underwriting for Wish. The share price is currently down 15% from the IPO price of $24. I would assume that those three companies would set higher price targets for Wish to justify the IPO price that they did the underwriting for.

1610235924,148,0,FALSE,1610236060,2,"Sup retards? Here's my opinions, make your own decisions. 

So I'll start with the TL;DR: Pot stocks are gonna 🚀💥🚀💥🚀💥 over the next 2 years and 2022/23 calls are future printers (or as early as 90 days) that even Elon himself will raise an eyebrow at. Decriminalization is just a layer of icing on a beautiful cake of banking reform. Also, Biden speaks on the same day Aphria presents at JP Morgan conference, big potential. Grab your helmet and HOLD the fuck on. 🚀💸🚀💸🚀

Okay retards, let's talk about weed. First off, some have mentioned this, but nowhere near enough. Since the Democrats took the senate, the next HUGE catalyst for the marijuana industry is the banking bill, this may cause bigger spikes in stocks than even legalization, as that will get priced in over time as momentum builds towards full legalization. Will stocks go up the day it is passed, absolutely. But will they be Powell level printers? Probably not. More like those busted Bitch McConnell ones. Basically like Pfizer's lackluster performance after saving the world. It was already priced in. So I believe pot stocks will do the same over a period of time. Meaning, again in my opinion, the biggest catalyst for Marijuana is the soonest change we can expect from our new government. I really expect this to be as soon as February and as late as July of this year, for the banking bill. Calls out to 2023 are extremely cheap imagining the upside coming, but calls in July might as well be BOGO. Do your own research as far as what timeline you guess the Senate will take. I'll tell you it was said that It will be addressed in the first session. 🤑🤑🤑🤑

Also, imagine basically any major company being forced to grow with no reasonable access to capital and no access to common tax write offs that every other company gets to use. Can they find debt currently? Sure. But basically at rates that a ""subprime"" lender would get, and then some. Access to reasonable and competitive capital is gonna be a game changer and allow them to invest and expand into things that are working in preparation of national legalization. Also, depending on how it all shakes out it may allow companies like Canopy (CGC) to purchase Acreage (A deal already made.) Or even better, companies like Marlboro to purchase Cronos (again, already a deal). Both deals are contingent on federal legalization though. 

Also, I really don't think it's a coincidence that Papa Biden is speaking at the JP Morgan conference on the same day as Aphria (Thursday, Biden speaks first). Any kind of renewed commitment to the M.O.R.E act or marijuana decriminalization from Biden would make stocks go on 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Also, I expect Aphria's presentation to go well. Why? Well, other than being retarded, we have all been locked down for months. You really think stoners stuck at home are smoking less? No, 🐻🌈, they are not. They are smoking hella weed and playing hella video games. Weed stocks and GME Gang are about to do some Ricky Bobby slingshot shit when Biden locks everyone down thanks to Covid 2.0. 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Though, I have no positions in GME just to be clear. I pray for the MOASS to be bestowed upon you by Lord Cohen, but theres just no way marijuana stocks aren't %1,000+ gains just waiting on Senate approval for fucking blastoff. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

So, within the next 2 years, we can pretty confidently say we will have made huge strides for the marijuana industry under a vice president who was the senate sponsor for the MORE act, and a president who wants to make himself appear to fight social injustice. Those conversations are going to be hard to have without bringing up marijuana.  Also, a slow path to legalization would be decimation for the chances of small companies to compete considering the infrastructure and experience more established companies will have. Not many companies will be in a position to supply a meaningful amount to a national demand. 

In summary for Marijuana moons: Marijuana jumps again on news of senate vote for MORE act, could jump also if  Papa ""Don't touch me there"" Biden renews any marijuana commitments, MOONS when MORE passes senate, jumps on news of full legalization talks, and finally baby moons again for legalization and starts a nice slow climb into the industry it is expected to be. There's going to be a lot of scaling and growth for quite a while after legalization to meet supply. Companies with experience doing this already are going to be in a much better position than newer companies just frantically trying to meet demand. 

Which companies?? For me I personally like Canopy and Cronos. Why? Because I'm betting on Corona (Canopy) to do well with a cannabis product in a party/bar scene and Marlboro (Cronos) to do well targeting daily users. Marijuana may have been legalized in multiple states, but there's still barely any places for consumers to enjoy THC in a social setting regardless of what state you're in. There's massive business to be made here, once it is an option. Alcohol wouldn't be where they are today without bars. Regardless, just pick one, do what you can and I think there will be a pretty green number there very soon. 🤷

To those unfamiliar on what ZSL is, it's an ETF that generally ""provides 2x the daily performance of silver"". Kind of like a Leveraged stock, but without margin-risk. Btw it's a terrible idea since proshares stocks - by nature - have decay, but fuck it. We're here to YOLO not be smart. Calls/puts are out for January 2022 btw. 

Currently up on the calls / puts, since I bought it when silver was at its lowest point recently (like $6.30 on ZSL). My average price on ZSL stocks is $8 tho since I bought the first wave when it initially dropped to $9.50, and keep buying more and more at lower costs

Why am I so bearish? Who tf knows. Especially with the US dollar going down. But I'm embracing my gut feeling that as the pandemic gets better, and the elections steady out (looking at u 🎺 supporters) silver will crash. Who knows, maybe the millionaires will see the crash on Friday and it'll rollercoaster outta control

Over the last two weeks a few reports and FinNews articles have come out expecting strong iPhone sales for Q4 earnings. A strong quarter is expected with the first 5G iPhones and pent up consumer discretionary spending. Any retard could have predicted that but I believe that analyst estimates are low and more importantly is not priced in at $129-133. 

A few articles from shills and morons below

[Bezinga: IPHONE 12 SALES ARE 21% BETTER THAN THE IPHONE 11](https://www.gizchina.com/2020/12/29/iphone-12-sales-are-21-better-than-the-iphone-11/)

[Bloomberg: Supply Chain Sends Bullish Signal on 5g After Tepid Start](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/iphone-supply-chain-sends-bullish-signal-on-5g-after-tepid-start)

I did my own due diligence in November and December to figure out how many iPhones they were actually selling. Apple's suppliers posted Q4 [record earnings](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/08/tsmc-sees-record-breaking-earnings-from-iphone-12-demand) signaling higher production levels than past cycles and analysts report Apple produced 79 million 5g units in Q4 and another 210 million units for FY2021.

 Analysts expect a[38% increase](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/22/apples-iphone-12-shipments-set-for-38-annual-growth-in-q1-2021) in units shipped for Q1 2021 and a similar increase for Q4 sales. Additionally the average price of each iPhone sold is expected to be higher than past years (typically around $750.) The model lineup this year is more expensive on average and analysts speculate flagship models iPhone 12, 12 Pro and Max make up the majority of increased sales. 

Additionally sales in Chinese markets are expected to rise Apple market share past the 20% threshold they've been stuck at. 

Using availability data from the Apple website, I found that base iPhone 12 models in any color were sold out (unavailable for in-store pickup) in 80% of Apple stores by the end of December after holiday sales. This isn't an exact count but does suggest that inventories of iPhone 12 models are low even for the commonly purchased base storage models.

 Analyst estimates are almost surely correct and may be on the low side if inventories are as low as they look. Additionally the stock has priced in expected lower sales numbers due to a delayed launch date and production holdups. AAPL is still trading below ATH from September when reports came out regarding delayed launches. I believe that Q4 sales will beat significantly  and  since the launch was delayed, demand in Q1 will be greater and guidance for the quarter will be increased during the earnings call. 

**Positions**

\\We've been sitting at $128-132 for the last two weeks but I have a target price of $142 for post earnings through early March. AAPL is $2.22 trillion behemoth so significant price changes are difficult but the IV on options is low enough (42%) to be worthwhile.

 I have already committed the remainder of my options account to this play. I picked up $132c 2/5 on Wednesdays dip but any calls $130+ exp after earnings are a very viable and potentially lucrative play. 

If you buy puts fuck you.

On top of that I just have that autistic little feeling about this play. Felt that way about longing TVIX in February 2018 which was a 10 bagger and Palantir at $9.

1610228363,13,0,FALSE,1610228852,0,"The cannabis market right now is so similar to the start of the green energy market.. its nowhere near done being bullish. Save for some small dips, there will very likely be a huge bullish trend for 2021. [EVEN NASDAQ AGREES](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cannabis-stocks-may-be-2021s-big-winners-2021-01-07). I’ve posted my positions a [few times](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/ktvx01/almost_60k_in_cannabis_stock_gains_14_18/), and I’ll continue to do so. But this is my reasoning for investing in cannabis stocks in general for 2021.

* I've been a bull on cannabis since the democrats had a strong pro-cannabis platform. But what made me go balls deep into the market was that the **UN changed its classification of cannabis**. Countries follow the UN closely for guidance on their own classification of controlled substances. Congress has [repeatedly cited](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2015/02/13/how-to-reschedule-marijuana-and-why-its-unlikely-anytime-soon/) the UN’s classification as one of the reasons for not changing it. Several countries immediately changed their stance on cannabis in response to this, including Israel, which In November 2020, announced that it was moving forward with a plan to legalize recreational cannabis nationally. “The country is aiming to implement recreational legalization within nine months, and even if there are delays, that means mid-to-late 2021.” (This is my reason for investing in **Canadian cannabis companies**, because they are already **poised to expand internationally since its legal there nationwide**)
* **THE SENATE IS NOW BLUE!** The Georgia runoffs were won by Democrats, and they can now swing the vote left with VP Harris. She promised it as part of her platform, so we know it will be prioritized. [CHUCK SHUMER SPONSORED THE MORE ACT](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-statement-on-ending-the-federal-prohibition-on-marijuana-following-the-house-passing-the-more-act). HE WILL BE [SENATE MAJORITY LEADER](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/nyregion/chuck-schumer-majority-leader.html). IT WILL 100% BE PRIORITIZED BETWEEN HIM AND VP HARRIS.
* EVERYONE predicted beforehand that the republicans would win Georgia... [everyone talked down decriminalization passing the house because of they believed it would NEVER pass the republican majority senate](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/04/942949288/house-approves-decriminalizing-marijuana-bill-to-stall-in-senate). But the left spent more than any senate race in history to encourage voters to go out and vote. Only once the race started did it become clear that the left had a chance. Then some gains from the surprise that they won. However the gains from 1/5 onwards definitely hasn’t been priced in for all the future legislation, because **some of it will be completely new legislation that wasn’t possible to consider before without a blue senate. THIS HASN'T BEEN PRICED INTO THE MARKET YET.**
* The **SAFE BANKING ACT** has bipartisan support, and is likely to pass [BEFORE decriminalization because it is tied into some stimulus bills.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/4cable-tv-international-inc-announces-certain-incoming-financials-filings-are-imminent-301203235.html)
* The government is broke post-COVID. There is a terrible image of the police. They don’t want to waste more resources on cannabis related crimes that would be fixed under decriminalization. And the tax revenue from decriminalization would be significant. **Decriminalization (THE MORE ACT) opens up the borders to interstate-commerce and international import/export**. This would all trickle down into Uncle Sam’s empty pockets.
* New York Governor Cuomo announced on Jan 6 his plan to legalize marijuana for adult use (right after New Jersey vote, as I anticipated in my last post) as part of his State of the State agenda. The next step is a ripple out on the North East. NY didn’t want to miss out on tax revenue, neither will any of the other states in the northeast within driving distance of NJ and NY. This is Cuomo’s third attempt in three years to legalize adult-use cannabis in the state; last year, Cuomo included a legalization proposal in his state budget, but the plan was ultimately cut in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

***Now that you understand why I’m going green, here’s my reasoning for my positions.***

**Tilray**

* largest cannabis company in the world by revenue post merger. Will run out of Seattle and New York City. New York Legalization on top of senate turning blue is a big catalyst for TLRY.
* Merger hasn’t completed yet, and the merger happened before the senate went blue.. that was the gamble APHA was making, and they won. The sky is the limit now. When they merge, they will reduce expenses and be much more likely to post profitable quarters. (This is why mergers have so much hype; the sum is &gt; than their parts because they can reduce operating expenses while maintaining revenue from the two companies)
* Tilray CEO Brendan Kennedy: “I think medical cannabis will be legal at the federal level, which means medical cannabis can cross state lines and be imported into the U.S., like we export cannabis from Canada and Portugal to about 15 countries now,” Kennedy said. “Anyone who thinks there’s a state-specific medical market is wrong.” As for the recreational market, Kennedy says the state-specific markets, with interstate trade banned, “are not going to last long.” Kennedy believes that cannabis will be distributed like alcohol and tobacco within two years’ time. That would require significant overhaul of US federal drug laws—and would significantly disrupt all US cannabis companies’ existing business models. Brendan Kennedy, the cannabis billionaire will step down as Tilray's chairman and CEO. Irwin D. Simon, Aphria's current chairman and CEO will take Kennedy's place.
* \[On December 18, 2020, just three days after the U.S. Senate adopted the Cannabidiol and Marihuana Research Expansion Act (CMREA or the Act) (more on this below), the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA or the Administration) published in the Federal Register a final rule, “Controls To Enhance the Cultivation of Marihuana for Research in the United States” (Rule), which finally paves the way for DEA to issue additional licenses to grow “marihuana” (i.e., cannabis) for research purposes.\]([https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/on-heels-of-senate-s-adoption-of-36129/](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/on-heels-of-senate-s-adoption-of-36129/))

**Greenlane Holdings**

* One of the largest global sellers of premium cannabis accessories. **Pax/JUUL/Volcano products.** I’ve had Pax products, and although I prefer Arizer because of the affordability, I can’t deny Pax has quality products and is like the “iPhone” of vaporizers. I like their products, I like their branding. There’s lots of hype and loyalty, especially with their Volcano desktop vaporizer.
* Strong US brands.
* The main reason they did poorly was bad timing. They IPO’d during the year that JUULs started being banned. They’re actually at all those levels again. Theres a ton of upside potential.
* Market cap is ridiculously low for some really renown brands all because of the JUUL flavor pod ban. Everyone knows Pax, Volcano, and JUUL. But no one knows Greenlane because of the bad timing of their IPO and the subsequent JUUL flavor ban. It’s crazy. They’ve already broke all time high for the year. But I’m holding until they break 1B market cap.
* Recently became the exclusive distributor for the world's first [gravity powered contactless water hookah.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/18/2129049/0/en/Greenlane-Becomes-Exclusive-Distributor-for-World-s-First-Gravity-Powered-Contactless-Water-Hookah.html)
* Overall i think too many people count it out just because of their IPO and subsequent decline in JUUL sales from the JUUL flavored pods ban. They definitely have the potential because of their strong branding and quality products. I’m betting on them having more high quality products in the future with equally loyal customers.

**Sundial Growers**

* They **must close above $1 per share for 10 consecutive sessions by June 26, 2021 or it will be** [delisted from NASDAQ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sundial-receives-approval-nasdaq-listing-130000598.html)**.** People see this as a fear factor, I see this as “they will do anything necessary to reach $1 for a week so they won’t be delisted”.. IMHO reverse splitter probably isn’t on the table since they could have done that in 2020, but instead applied for a 6 month extension after announcing “alternative strategic investments”. We can already see this by their **predatory loan SPAC spinoff.**
* Rumors of a merger with CGC; also purchased a SPAC recently and entered an agreement with Zenabis, immediately claiming they defaulted. Turning that SPAC into predatory loan/debt repurchasing company. Imo if they want to complete a merger, it would be easy to sell ownership through that SPAC to the buyer.
* **THEY RECENTLY WENT** [DEBT FREE](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-announces-completion-of-financial-restructuring-and-debt-free-status-301196607.html) by selling off unprofitable assets in the business. This means we are much more likely to see earnings in future quarters, and they are much more attractive for mergers.
* Because they are indoor growers, they are more likely to be bought up by a company in the consolidating Canadian cannabis market than fail all together. The amount of space licensed to grow cannabis in Canada is now heavily skewed toward outdoor cultivation instead of indoor for the first time, [according to new data from Health Canada](https://www.newsbreak.com/news/1501283915298/licensed-outdoor-cannabis-canopy-exceeds-indoor-for-first-time-in-canada). A growing population of licenses for outdoor growers means that there aren’t as many indoor licenses being given out... If a company **ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD** wants to **quickly expand into indoor growing OR into the west**, they would have to purchase an existing company that has the license to quickly do so. This is WAY faster, and a guaranteed way to obtain a license rather than applying for one and waiting x amount of months and be rejected for some requirement that wasn’t met.
* From my own experience, outdoor cannabis is subpar quality to indoor grown cannabis. So a growing market for outdoor cannabis doesn’t necessarily mean its better... it is likely just cheaper. I would imagine a high quality “craft cannabis” company would want to purchase them, or an existing outdoor growing company that wants to quickly expand to indoor grown cannabis. With this being a Canadian company, there’s a chance a company in another country like Israel would be interested in purchasing it in the near future.

**Planet 13 Holdings**

* Biggest tourist trap in Las Vegas if you’re a stoner, casual smoker, or just wanting to try it. From my own experience, I think they will continue to be successful. If I went around the US trying other brands I’d probably be more confident in putting 5-10% of my portfolio into those picks or choosing to not include them lol. Like for example, I used to have Curaleaf. But there's tons of bad feedback on Curaleaf, a friend has tried it said the nug is really subpar quality and if I tried their nug I’d probably confirm that I wouldn’t want to invest in them. With Planet 13, i’ve seen the ambience and tried the product myself. It’s definitely a lot of hype price wise, but still quality. This is my own bias showing, but I still think they’ve got solid fundamentals and excellent location/strong US branding.

I’m well aware of other good stocks like Greenthumb, Cresco, etc, but these stocks **haven’t been swinging as hard in response to pro-cannabis news**. E.g. ***TLRY swung more than 20%*** some days from pro-cannabis news...I will likely reduce my current positions shortly after inauguration, after some news about the timeline for cannabis legislation, and diversify my positions more between these other good picks.

1610225997,104,0,FALSE,1610226565,3,"# Twitter Puts are the logical hedge at the moment

# 

Let me explain why:  


**1. Twitter has just provoked the eyes of Congress in an unspeakably stupid way**  
Twitter has for years attempted to fend off Congress by claiming that they're fundamentally neutral, and their Terms of Service don't have real ramifications to speech. By suspending hundreds of prominent conservatives, including POTUS, they've now declared a partisan war which, I can guarantee you, House Democrats are going to be asking ""why didn't you do this before?"". I think the Republican talking points are going to be obvious, but if there was ever a reason to repeal Section 230, this is it.  


**2. Twitter's fundamentals suck, and everyone knows it**  
The straight fundamentals of Twitter are terrible. They've got a stagnated user base, and by kicking off Trump, they've provoked an exodus which will almost definitely show up in their Feb 9th earnings. At the moment, puts are cheap, as they've been on a bit of a tear upwards. . . but I don't see this continuing. They could lose a lot of revenue from their recent actions, but I don't see anyone hopping ***onto Twitter because they did what they did. This is a net-loss action.***   


**3. Puts are cheap**   


If there was ever a good reason to go against Twitter, it's that puts are super cheap at the moment. No one could have foreseen that the Trump rally would go this way. I work at one of the social media companies (not Twitter), and trust me, it caught everyone off-guard. This decision has fundamentally reshaped the investment thesis around social media; non-US dominated versus US dominated / regulatory and anti-trust risk, etc etc etc. Puts are cheap as fuck. I recently paid for some puts (5 contracts of TWTR $48.50 Put 1/15 +  10 contracts of TWTR $40.00 Put 2/26), and it's discounted for sure.  


**4. In summary:**  
Ya'll are smart enough to see that this recent action is bullshit. I'm willing to say that this is actually the beginning of the end for Twitter. $FB will last longer because of Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. Reddit has a decent trajectory, but monetization is a bit of an issue. Pinterest is actually the biggest dark-horse of the bunch, though I'm personally bullish on Indian stocks atm.

Bearings will be the high performance high precision components driving performance advantages in the industry. Ceramic bearings have major advantage over traditional steel bearings in EVs cause the electric current can flow over steel bearings and cause micro welds/ premature failure. 

Also if the world is charging forward into infrastructure upgrades, automation, robotics, hydrogen, wind turbines, etc then bearings stocks should benefit.

This is interesting because ES has always driven orderflow to the market. Volume and price action on ES matches TSLA on Friday. Financials and energy were down. Big tech was flat yet S&amp;P 500 was up on the day largely due to TSLA. When factoring in volatility, TSLA now has more control of SPY than AAPL. Your 401Ks are now in the hands of Papa Elon.

The more things change, the more they stay the same :)

Some choice quotes:

&gt; Not surprisingly, the critics are gushing. ""Enron has built unique and, in our view, extraordinary franchises in several business units in very large markets,"" says Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer.

&gt; This business, which Enron pioneered, is usually described in vague, grandiose terms like the ""financialization of energy""--but also, more simply, as ""buying and selling gas and electricity."" In fact, Enron's view is that it can create a market for just about anything; as if to underscore that point, the company announced last year that it would begin trading excess broadband capacity. 

&gt; But describing what Enron does isn't easy, because what it does is mind-numbingly complex. CEO Jeff Skilling calls Enron a ""logistics company"" that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity and figures out the most cost-effective way to transport that commodity to its destination.

&gt;  Along with broadband, Enron has ambitious plans to create big businesses trading a huge number of other commodities, from pulp and paper to data storage to advertising time and space. Perhaps most promising is its Enron Energy Services business, which manages all the energy needs of big commercial and industrial companies. Skilling has told analysts that its new businesses will generate a return on invested capital of about 25% over the long run.

&gt; In the end, it boils down to a question of faith. ""Enron is no black box,"" says Goldman's Fleischer. ""That's like calling Michael Jordan a black box just because you don't know what he's going to score every quarter.""",0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktya1u/interesting_article_about_enron_from_2001/,,1/9/2021,20:06:17,3:06:17 PM,15:06:17

We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

Few others received similar message for using c*uk. Can we please get a list of words that reddit doesn't like anymore pinned to the top of the sub or in the wiki or something? 

It will be very helpful.

SPY is sitting at ATH of $381, an increase of  67% + from the bottom of market crash

 13% + from previous ATH before crash                

 The previous 4 months saw an increase of 10.43% from October to January   

Continuing on this path from January to April, a 4 month drawn out 10% increase would land SPY at a price point of:  $ 419.10                      

 Target Price  $ 419.10        

 Breakeven  $ 405.61         

Current $381.00     

%+ to B/E: 6%                 

We only need to see a 6% increase  over 4 months to reach breakeven point. While under normal circumstances,   6% over 4 months is a gamble, here is my autistic DD.

Fed anounced $2k stim which is going to boost the markets overall when it hits peoples accounts. You can say it's priced in, but nothing is priced in in this market until it actually happens.  Fed printed 4 trillion dollars in  2020 with more to come in 2021. Inflation is also contributing to the increase in the bull market.

IMO the only way market tanks is if interest rates increase, which won't happen until at least 2022.              Biden has anounced a multi-trillion dollar stimulus to be rolled out VERY soon. Billions allocated to improving vaccine distribution, billions for small businesses, $2k stimulus for citizens, extended unemployment benefits, basically, trillions of dollars will be flooding into the economy to stimulate the fuck out of it. Fed are determined to keep everything afloat at whatever the cost.

&amp;#x200B;

The question isn't ""will spy hit 400$?"", the question is will SPY hit $400 by April? With all these catalysts I think theres a damn good chance it will.

&amp;#x200B;

Is my train of thought rational? Trying to decide whether or not to yolo x20 04/16 400c.

Hopefully some good discussion comes from this post. Walked through my rational with father-in-law but hes a   🌈🐻 that thinks everything will tank next week.

1610214975,39,0,FALSE,1610215186,1,"Bloom Energy (BE) will be as big as TSLA in 5 years.

Bloom Energy is a fuel cell company that is transitioning to hydrogen fuel cells in 2021 and have commercial hydrogen fuel cell in 2021 \[2\]

Hydrogen will be bigger than Lithium-Ion batteries.  It hasn't thus far because of the cost to produce hydrogen.  ***But with the Biden administration and EU planning to invest heavily invest in solar and wind, the input cost to hydrogen electrolysis should decline enough to make hydrogen as cheap as natural gas*** \[2\].  This is why hydrogen is such a huge growth play now.  The economics are only now just about to tip it into be the most economical form of electricity \[3\]\[2\].

The advantage of green hydrogen is that is completely green but as a couple of huge market advantage:

1. More power density than Lithium battery.  What this means is that you can have vehicles going 600 miles unlike lithium battery;  or a small fuel cell footprint vs a large solar footprint for commercial buildings.  Picture  the size of a truck (fuel cell) vs a parking lot (solar) to power a big box retailer.
2. Quick charge.  Fueling a fuel cell would take minutes rather than hours with Lithium batteries.

Note:  blue hydrogen is made from natural gas. grey hydrogen is made from fossil fuel.  green hydrogen is made from wind/solar/hydrodam/nuclear

The EU already moving to a green hydrogen economy \[3\].  Bloom recently hired a GE to expand into the EU for 2021 \[1\]

So comparatively, we have a company with technology comparable to PLUG.

BE made 800M in annual sales for 2020 (natural gas fuel cells).  They plan to address the hydrogen market by 2022. Like PLUG, they plan to have 1GW of capacity 2025.

Lastly, their board is comprise of government insiders and the former CEO of GE \[4\].  So they are well position to gain more regulation in favor of hydrogen and knowledge on how to expand internationally.

You are buying BE for when hydrogen will be the main fuel source starting in 2025 onward. It will overtake Lithium Ion by 2035.  Buying into hydrogen now is like buying into TSLA when it introduce its first lithium ion battery.  And we are only here because of the deep investments in solar and wind to reduce the cost to produce green hydrogen.

Thanks to you autists, this mofo got me on the fast track to options. I nuked my account in the first year of trading by -50%. It. Was. Great. Such a rush. And thank baby Jesus for the March crash because that's when everything turned around. Since then I have rode calls into Valhalla and my account has doubled, even weeds stocks which comprised of 90% of my portfolio in 2018/2019 have been revived (haven't sold, still holding until the shit is green in my state).  


But there comes a time in a man's life when he must make a decision. I remember in 2018 it wasn't so bad and gay to be a bear...it was just part of the cycle it seemed. I think the year of the bear is upon us. Michael Burry, from the big short, who got in too early to the shortage of the housing market was eventually right. Granted, he entered the short too soon and he could have saved \~20% by timing it better. I figure he's learned from this and got his timing down much better over the decade. He is short TSLA, he didn't say it when we hit $420 , $1000, post 5:1 split $690...he's chosen to do it now, and since then it has risen nearly +30% more since he first said he is short TSLA. When TSLA falls, I think it is what starts the 'correction' mode on SPY and the rest of the market.

I think the democrats / Biden are worried coming into a market that is at all time highs, for fear that it'll most likely have to crash during their term in power and people might want to blame them. I think they try to crash it with the changing of the guards when J-Pow is replaced with J-Yellen; they'll try to crash it 1st few weeks in office saying that 'it was like this before we got here, blame the orange man' rather than giving it a year or few months into their term.

Conspiracy numbers to do math with:  
(a) Burry Housing Short gain = 489%  
(b) Since Burry started shorting TSLA = up by 30%  
(c) $420.69 reversed = $960.24  
(d) Year of the last time the capitol was breached = 1814  
(e) Papa Elon's Net Worth = $195B  
(f) TSLA market cap = $834B  
(g) Year Elon became CEO of TSLA &amp; the year Burry's short paid off = 2008

1610213352,38,0,FALSE,1610213582,1,"Some back of envelope math on CLOV.

Only 50k members, yes, but each member leads to gross premiums of 10 - 14k per year, so they are around 600 million in gross preimums peryear run rate now.

Then you take an industry average MLR of 15%, which represents how much they have lft over after paying for medical costs, which gives us roughly 90 million of ARR.

I think valuation at NAV for the SPAC was 3.7 billion, so at current prices its like 5.9 billion implied market cap

that means implied P/ ARR of 65x, which lets face it is pretty damn high. And if we cut ARR in half to estimate annual revenue, we get 45 m reveneu, and 130x P/S. holy shit that is high. TSLA is in the 30s and TDOC is in the 40s.

Then again this is a much smaller company in a massive market and its gaining marketshare.

HOwever, it is trying a ""direct contracting program"" in 2021, which if successful (who knows..) is projected to get the company to 273,000 members in 2021. With that many members, the gross annual premiums are 3.27 billion, and assuming 15% MLR that gives us 491 million in ARR.

P/ projected ARR = 12x which is a pretty fucking modest ratio. And I'm aware you're not supposed to do P/ARR. So lets cut the ARR in half to represent the revenues of that year, that gives us P/S of 24x. Still not insanely aggressive considering the comps.

Then again, maybe the company's member projection is totally off. Its possible. If that is true it will drop like a rock, becuase they are setting analyst expectations and we know what happens when you disappoint the analysts.

Then again, they're smart people with access to the best minds in health insurance and business buildilng, so they likely have some basis for this projection.

Nontheless, lets assume they ionly get hafl that number of members in 2021.

So 2021 they have 135,000 members at end of year.

That implies gross annual premiums run rate of 1.62 billion

And with the MLR that imples ARR of 243 million

Cutting that in half, we get 121.5 million revenue

Or P/S of 48x and change, very high, too high.

But we already established that if they don't get their projected number of mmebers, the valuation will dro a lot.

i hope you enjoyed this. please poke holes, this is just back of envolepe math.

Probably insurance comanies are not valued on sales, probably on profitability-- but you cant apply the same metrics you apply to UNH to CLOV becuase one is small and fast gorwing and the other is large and slow growing. That is like applying Toyota valuation metrics to TSLA 5 years ago and saying TSLA will go down. Using the wrong model, leads to wrong conclusion.

So I am using sales because that IMO is the best metric for fast growing cos that defer profitability to focus on growth.

In simple terms, CRM software helps businesses track customer information, log service issues, and manage their marketing campaigns. Although retail is the most logical beneficiary of CRM solutions, it's by no means the end-all. Manufacturing, healthcare, information technology, and service industries all benefit from real-time customer data to better serve their existing clients and make add-on sales.

In terms of CRM software, [salesforce is the kingpin](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/28/got-1000-3-stocks-to-buy-to-start-2021-with-a-bang/). **Gartner** estimated that it controlled 18.3% of the global CRM market at the end of 2019. That's more than double its next-closest competitor. With the addition of **Slack Technologies**, which salesforce has [agreed to acquire for $27.7 billion in cash and stock](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/salesforce-building-the-operating-system-for-the-f/), salesforce will have another way to cross-sell its products on a rapidly growing business-based platform.

Considering that most [software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/saas-stocks/) are valued at 20 or more times sales, salesforce looks like an absolute bargain at less than 10 times fiscal 2021 sales.

Xiaomi Ticker $XIACF is probably one of the most undervalued companies at the moment and here is why:

Despite its weak branding in the Western hemisphere, Xiaomi is one of the largest tech companies in the world. Standing at rank four, Xiaomi competes against electronic manufacturing giants such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft.

Affordable pricing

Xiaomi offers smartphones and other electronic devices at extremely competitive prices. This is extremely important for two reasons. First off, Xiaomi’s budget-friendly pricing allows them to compete for the more budget-friendly consumers in developed regions. Secondly, it allows them to enter new, previously-untapped markets in which smartphones were previously too expensive. For example, Xiaomi is able to sell millions of devices in the Asian market, especially in China and India, which would be impossible as a luxury brand such as Apple or Samsung.

Substantial profit margins

Most amazing of all, Xiaomi is able to offer quality products at affordable prices, and still make plenty of profit for themselves. Quite consistently, Xiaomi has posted profits amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. Xiaomi can thank low manufacturing costs for their high-profit margins. These low manufacturing costs are likely due to the low cost of labor in China, as well as the significant economy of scale which arises when manufacturing so many devices.

TLDR; undervalued stock with high potential waiting to blow up.

1610204998,157,0,FALSE,1610205010,1,"TLDR: bad fundamentals, bubble burst insurance, political landscape

&amp;#x200B;

There are 3 reasons why I'm going to buy put leaps on twitter this coming Monday. I usually stay away from puts as I'm a bull myself, but the uncertainty we're facing now requires some kind of hedge and I believe this is one of the better hedges out there. You guys do your own DD as always.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fundamentals**

Twitter doesn't actually turn up any profit. They have a negative cash flow and this is despite being public for over 7 years now. Their stock price has hovered between 14$ and 60$ over these past 7 years and its valuation right now has reached the point it was in 2015. 85% of twitter's money comes from ads. This is due to take a hit due to Apple's upcoming privacy changes which makes it harder to do targeted ads. At the same time, as the pandemic is beginning (eventually) to wind down, online commerce should go down a bit, maybe not to pre pandemic levels, but still, and that will further affect ad revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bubble insurance**

Whether we are in a bubble or not doesn't matter. However, due to skyrocketing valuations of tech companies, you'd have to be extremely retarded not to at least hedge your positions. I'm sure most of you read the arguments for and against the bubble on other threads by now, so I'm not going to debate those here. What I'm going to assume is that there is a CHANCE that we're in a bubble and that it may burst at any time during the next 2 years. Could be tomorrow, could be in 2 years, could be in 5 years, could be fucking never idk. 

But if you want to hedge, Twitter is one of the good companies you want to buy put leaps on. It's an online tech company that's already losing money in an environment that's supposed to make them TONS. if that doesn't reek of failure, idk what does.

&amp;#x200B;

**Political headwinds**

I don't want to get political here, but we do have to at least mention the current situation. Twitter's decision to give a big fuck you to half of america is not how business works. If you're a conservative, forget about 'fairness'. If you're a liberal, forget about 'revenge'. If you want to make money, all you need to look into is just how monumentally they're fucked up from a business perspective. Twitter's user base has been hovering around 320 million mark since 2015 until today, while their userbase grew from 30 million to 300 million from 2010 to 2015. Clearly they've stagnated for a long while now. One of the reasons why social media has risen to be so influential over the past decade has been the freedom it allows users to express themselves. Big tech didn't pick sides in the beginning so their platforms attracted people from all over the place. 

Now, I don't know what portion of twitter's userbase is conservative, but it's surely not inconsequential. Booting off the platform this portion of the userbase will only make the company's value go down even more over the long term. There are also non conservatives who value freedom of speech who will also bleed out from the platform. Less users = less ads = less money = lower stock value.

I haven't even mentioned the big tech antitrust and monopoly issues they're facing. And this is something the DEMOCRATS have suggested.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: All the signs point to twitter's demise. The company has very few positive things looking forward to, and most of these positive things are market wide, such as the new stimulus package. Any one sign written above in itself is not a good enough reason to short the stock. But all of them combined, well... do with this what you will.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktsipd/im_calling_bullshit_why_im_shorting_twtr/,,1/9/2021,15:09:58,10:09:58 AM,10:09:58

   Tar-Palantir was the twenty-fourth King of Númenor. His birth name was Inziladûn (""Flower of the West"" in Adûnaic), the son of Ar-Gimilzôr. His father was a bitter opponent of the Valar and the Elves, and had banished the speaking of the Elven tongues in his realm. However, Inziladûn's mother, Inzilbêth, was secretly a member of the Faithful and taught her son to be an Elf-friend.

When Inziladûn took up the Sceptre it was a time of great darkness in Númenor. Ever since the time of Tar-Atanamir, every King had spoken against the Valar and questioned the Ban they had put upon the Númenóreans against sailing into the West. Inziladûn sought to repent of these actions of his predecessors and took a Quenya name in the tradition of his ancestors: Tar-Palantir (""The Far-sighted""). 

Once again the White Tree was properly tended, for Tar-Palantir's gift of foresight allowed him to ascertain that if the White Tree perished, then the line of Kings would also come to an end. The King also faithfully observed the ancient religious ceremonies of the Númenóreans at due times.

However, the Valar did not respond to Tar-Palantir's repentance because of the insolence of the Kings before him, and because most of the Númenóreans were still hostile to the Lords of the West, and were led by Gimilkhâd, Tar-Palantir's own brother. Nor did Elven ships ever come from Tol Eressëa to Númenor again. Tar-Palantir became filled with sorrow over the continuing rebellion of his people, and began to spend more of his time at the tower of Tar-Minastir in the west of the isle, hoping at least to see Eressëa on the horizon. But even the sight of it was withheld from him.

Tar-Palantir married late and had only one child, a daughter named Míriel. Míriel was named his official successor and would have followed his policies, but her rightful place as Queen of Númenor was usurped by her husband, Ar-Pharazôn.

Some moron pays me for the option to buy some shares I own IF said shares reach a price I decide by a future date that I decide. 

Scenario A: some idiot pays me a premium, the price doesn’t reach the strike by expiry, I keep both the premium and the shares.

Am I missing something? Is it really that simple?

1610184760,22,0,FALSE,1610184771,1,"So I’m not sure to flair this as DD or discussion as I’m not sure myself, first time posting here.

I know this stock hasn’t been talked about for some time here, but I’d like to know your opinions.

Atm I might be drunk so definitely ask for clarification. Shoot it down ifI’m stupid, I’m ok with that. Failure is part of the learning process.

At the moment it’s pretty clear that the ARM deal, as the P/E of 115 would suggest, probably in a relatively rational market is one of the few things that would justify its current value. 

And as some of us would know from a few months ago, this deal can’t go through without the approval of the Chinese and Europeans, the biggest being of course the Chinese.

For those who don’t know why the takeover is a big deal: ARM is a British company who controls the biggest share of patents on IP cores: “a reusable unit of logic, cell or integrated circuit layout design” acoording to Wikipedia, so they’re makig their revenue by selling their patented chip designs, thus being integral to a huge part of the semiconductor industry. 

What people fear is that this would mean a near-monopoly in this semi-conductor industry by Nvidia: e.g. ARM delivers around 90% of the smartphone chips. Given the fact that Nvidia is trying to grow in the data centre and AI development sectors, ARM is pivotal in this. It would be like getting a scientist in Civilization V: a huge boost in comparison to their competitors, of which INTL consistently underperforms and AMD is still not yet on the level if it comes to GPU’s.


Given the fact this would give Nvidia a lot of power in China: ARM has a joint venture in China and being a US company they might not trust this deal carries a big risk. Even though Softbank, ARM and Nvidia were confident that this deal would go through the 18-month paperwork that is this takeover, but since Jack Ma has been gone missing, things might look different.

I’ve seen people here saying it’s the CCP being butthurt, but I’ve got a different view of it, and I thought it was the Washington Post that thought the same: the CCP wakes up to the danger that the big tech and data companies provide as they present a enormous threat to their power. Being dependent on Western technology and Biden still willing to continue the hard line (albeit in a more subtle way) of Trump towards China the stance towards US companies doesn’t change. The stance of the CCP towards tech companies in general might. And thus the initially already unsure deal becomes even more unsure, as the Brits fear that the takeover will lose jobs and knowledge in their country. 

I’d like to hear your thoughts on this: how has the Jack Ma incident changed the CCP’s stance on technology? And how does it affect the Western companies? There might still change a lot in the temaining 15 months but I myself do expect a harder line towards Western tech companies in China. I’d love to hear your arguments against and for.

Bull case: I’d say they’re leading in some very potential big industries and they are very able to convert that lead: the competition is still far away. With ARM they will consolidate this.

Bear case: When looking at the P/E it’s overvalued and potential upside is priced in and it seems that due to the wait of the approval the stock atm is going sideways, and there might be resistance against the deal. I’ve not mentioned it earlier but also the Europeans don’t seem too happy with this, not to mention China which I did mention.

I hope you’ve become any wiser of this, questions or sources do ask.

1610177688,90,0,FALSE,1610177699,1,"This is my first post in this godforsaken echo chamber of NIO, PLTR, TSLA, VALE, and GME. I’m tired of hearing mostly the same shit, as I’m sure most of you 🌈 🐻’s are too. I’m presenting a completely different, yet solid stock with loads of potential.

Do you remember when Nike (NKE) and Adidas (ADDYY) were both sitting around $20/share around 2010-11? Well, Hanes Brands (HBI) is sitting nicely (as of writing) at $15.36. The company has solid revenue of $7B (2019) and most importantly, they have a winner of a brand in Champion clothing. 

When was the last time you saw anyone ever wear this historically shit and uncomfortable Walmart brand clothing? For me, it’s been over the past month. I’m a gym rat and I’ve been seeing shoes, workout shirts, and sweaters all touting the Champion crescent. I never saw this shit in the past 10 years of going to the gym. 

It definitely seems like Champion is evolving into a higher-end sports clothing brand. Because of this I can’t find the shit in Walmart anymore, I picked up a workout shirt from them a couple of weeks ago, and it is COMFORTABLE. Sure, it’s not Lulu Lemon (LULU) type bougie suburban athletic wear, but I see Champion clothing everywhere I go now. Doesn’t matter if it’s at Chipotle or on Instagram vanity pictures, Champion is slowly pushing into the reputable athletic clothing market as we speak. 

Hanes Brands Inc is solid, and has a good reputation. There is almost no reason why this stock wouldn’t go up in the near future, especially if an extra 2k in stimmy is passed.

TLDR: Hanes Brands Inc. (HBI) is a solid company and has the prospects of potentially becoming a Nike or Adidas with their brand of clothing, Champion. Buy now while it’s around $15/share.

Hey retards, I am bringing you here the latest rocket that’s going to go to the moon and give us infinite tendies. Magna international (MGA). I put 7 rockets in the title because you can multiple your money by 7 (source: my DD and my dreams) 

Magna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of vehicles and light trucks worldwide. The company operates through four segments: Body Exteriors &amp; Structures, Power &amp; Vision, Seating Systems, and Complete Vehicles. 

Notable Clients: Aston Martin, BMW, Ford, Daimler, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubish, Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo…
As you can see every big company is their client

An example of a complete vehicle made is the Jaguar I-Pace. This is one of the keys. We have got a lot of IPO money going into EV’s companies that don’t have any manufacture capability. Here is when Magna is gonna enter the scene and go to the moon and beyond 

They are present in 27 countries,+165.000 employees, 13.000 engineers and nearly 40B in sales. 

Revenue is growing in the last 10 years, went from  28B to 40B 

EBITDA is growing too, 2B to 4B 

EV/Ebitda is 12x 

Debt/Ebitda is less than 2x 

CFO went from 1,2B to 3,9B in the past 10 years. 

Steady Capex 

Shares Outstanding, good job with buybacks, went from 471M to 306M 

Free cash flow per share went form 0,15$ to almost 8$  

The average free cash flow yield the last tean years is nearly 10% 
 

They just signed an agreement last month with LG that made the stock rise 10% 

And the most important thing, they’re the frontrunners to build the Apple EV car. If/When this happens and is official ... Can you imagine the jump we'll see?? 

As they say, buy with the rumors and sell with the news. But even without this, Magna is the frontrunner to be one of the most important companies of the next 10 years, since the car companies want to externalize as much as possible to continue competing. 

When Apple and other EV companies begin to announce big big deals with MGA, it would be too late.

* ^(One of those, the Lithium Americas Thacker Pass project in Nevada,) **is expected to be approved on Jan. 15, according to an official at the Bureau of Land Management.**
* “**It’s been a good, collaborative process with state and federal authorities. We look forward to the decision**,” ^(said Jon Evans, chief executive of Lithium Americas, which has been developing the project for more than a decade. Lithium is a key component of electric vehicle batteries.)
* **Administration officials tell Reuters** ^(they plan to publish a raft of decisions on Jan. 15 that will expand miners’ access to federal lands), **give final approval to Lithium Americas Corp’s Nevada lithium mine** ^(and approve a land swap for a Rio Tinto Ltd Arizona copper mining project, among other steps.)

**Notes about the Thacker Pass Project:**

* Located in Nevada
* Nevada has recently run out of unemployment funding due to COVID and has asked for federal loans. Nevada WILL NOT deny lithium-based revenue from companies like $LAC and have already approved tax incentives for them.
* Training of local workers for land development has already begun. Jobs are already created and filled. 
* The Thacker Pass is the largest known Lithium deposit in the US and 2nd largest globally 

This is truly revolutionary in the EV and lithium-based mining. As we all know EV companies have been on an absolute run lately as well as all lithium companies.

It had a nice pullback today and consolidated at $18.50 before closing at $19.33. Expect this to absolutely run next week to $25-30.

**Price Targets for next Friday:**

* $25-30
* This would put the $20 calls at $5-10 from a 1.25 entry

**Final note:** 

* Stocks only go up
* It's an EV play

1610164910,69,0,FALSE,1610164922,1,"To understand how stocks move, first, you gotta understand the interaction between buyers and sellers. Basically, it's Econ-101 supply and demand. Too much demand? Buyers will have to raise their prices so that sellers sell.

Second, the types of market participants. Active and passive participants.

Passive participants are like, buy buy sell buy sell buy sell buy buy buy sell buy sell sell buy. This is almost completely automated and determined by the weighting of the stock versus the index or the methodology that it is following.

The bots of VOO, for example, doesn't give a damn if an accounting scandal has happened or if a new breakthrough has been reached. Every day, it will buy and sell stocks indiscriminately, following the algos.

And increasingly, newer assets under management are coming mostly under those passive investment vehicles such as passive ETFs, passive mutual funds etc leading to them having a larger and larger share of the market. (I am coming to active participants later)

Thirdly, you gotta understand hedging. Which is basically an investment position to offset losses. Example, you sell a naked call. You see the stock moving closer to the strike price. You immediately buy shares to ensure that you don't take a loss.

# Ok, now why do individual stocks move?

They move based on events (plain old news, market-related movements etc). Now, let's go back to active participants such as retail investors, hedge funds, fund managers etc.

Suppose, there's a quarterly earnings report coming out for ASML. Almost all active participants have somehow figured from various news reports that the earnings report will be good because of the huge demand for ASML's product.

As a result, an active fund manager takes a big position on that stock. The stock moves a bit. Hedge funds and other firms also take their positions.

A retard post about the company's upcoming good earnings on the internet and all early retard investors quickly get in.

The stock moves up. In the meantime, the passive funds are adjusting their position in the stock, realtime. If it's going up. They are buying more to adjust their position.

Now, don't forget. Those passive ETFs or funds have other semiconductor stocks in their ETFs and shits. Which means, even if only ASMLs quarterly earnings were supposed to be good, other stocks of the same sector will benefit. As there are tons of both active and passive algos that don't trade individual stocks but ETFs and similar stuff due to liquidity reasons.

This gets even better. Suppose, lots of retail investors are also buying call options of this stock. If the underlying continues to go up, the delta could keep on rising. Suppose it went from 5% to 10% to 20%. This would force the option sellers to keep on buying more and more shares and could lead to gamma explosion where the market makers create a violent feedback loop due to hedging.

It gets more fun than that. Remember the various HFT firms and scalper bots? Well, they know it all too well that some firms are busy at hedging frenzy. They also join in on the feeding frenzy that is this stock.

After said earnings release(or most likely, just before it), most of the active participants like retail traders and hedge funds may well start taking profits. And the stock generally runs up more than the expected in the first place.

This leads to the violent unwinding of the positions that we generally see after the earnings release. Because everything happens in the exact reverse order I just described here. That's why it's a terrible gamble to buy options in hope of a good earnings release or similar news.

It feels euphoric if you are on the right side of the tide and equally depressing if you are on the wrong side of the tide.

The same thing can happen in the opposite direction if a piece of bad news is expected or happens.

Here, earnings release is just one of the events that I described. It could be any event like index inclusion, regulatory shifts, stock splits, analyst upgrade-downgrades, some fund manager or hedge funds buying the stock etc.

Also, don't forget that all this is also affecting other stocks in the same sector/region etc due to them being connected through passive investments and active participants exploiting the passive participants.

A very recent example of this happening would be the stock PLTR. Remember, they signed a contract with FDA for $44M but the stock moved almost $10B or more(I haven't calculated) or about 20%. Two weeks ago maybe, Citron declared short attack and a violent unwinding of positions happened and the stock went down about 15-20% after climbing 10-12% that day. Or the day before that when it climbed 20%+.

Now I have sold calls on PLTR (yeah, I like it that your 12/04, 12/11, 12/18 expired or will expire worthless).

**This is not how all stocks move.**

But a large portion of the stocks that are mentioned here in the sub move this way. This is why it sometimes feels like to you folks as KINDA pump and dump. But whether you retards accept it or not I know you guys are the cream of the crop. While most of you act as if you know nothing, I know very well most of you probably make money.

You guys are like people who watch tech reviews to buy a smartphone.

Ok, I completely went out of topic. Sorry.

**This is not how all stocks move.**

Some boomer stocks like MMM, JBT etc may have low retail interest. In those cases, the stocks are almost absolutely up to the mercy of other active participants, who or which may as well not care that much leaving those stocks to the hands of the algos of passive participants.

But in those whole processes, there's almost no price discovery that's actually working. Passive algos are buying and selling (but mostly creating buying pressure) completely arbitrarily, HFT bots buying and selling because, reasons.

The participants who are using traditional valuation metrics, analyzing the good and bad of stocks are getting outnumbered by all the other participants and generally speaking, the volume of their trades are also declining in the overall market. Think of big participants like Berkshire(which is undoubtedly the most powerful active participant in the market), pension funds, sovereign funds etc, they barely buy or sell any stocks they have if they have entered on the right price.

Sure, I am kinda underselling the influence of big institutional investors, but it is not completely without any merit.

**So you are saying there's no price discovery in the various stocks?**

Absolutely not. Even in the greatly flawed system I described being used by most market participants there's plenty of it happening by newsflashes, sell-side analyst recommendations, retail fomoers etc.

Only the stocks that have heavy institutional ownerships, with a healthy retail interest seems to me to be less volatile(this is my intuition speaking really, so this statement is probably false in the first place) such as MSFT etc and they probably have better price discovery.

**What about those stocks doubling the day they IPO?**

The reason behind that is very simple. Tons of retail investors place Market Orders. This means they are ready to pay whatever the price this thing will go for. In those scenarios, investment banks can hardly control the price of the stock as there's just too much demand to satisfy. In short, it's a feeding frenzy. And this is one of the things that's primarily driven by retail interest.

**What about those SPACs and low-float stocks?**

Well, this again needs no explaining. Too low float, too much interest. Various whales also know this and use this for their benefit. After the merger is complete(or slightly before it) retail investors and whales leave for the next thing in the line. So the stock tanks and the stock price never recovers.

If the company that's being pumped is actually any good, the stock would likely later get the attention it deserves after the sell-off.

I hope all those points are good enough to explain most of the funky behaviour an individual stock would make. I know my explanations are not exhaustive and there are many angles I haven't covered, but it is what it is.

Now, to the MORE IMPORTANT STUFF. Individual stocks also move due to numerous macro reasons. When the entire market is in a euphoric phase, you can throw a dart and that stock would move up. The opposite and the stock would go down.

# Why and how does the market move?

Liquidity. This is probably the most important thing that drives the market as a whole.

Excess liquidity that's circling around will inevitably try to enter into the economy in one way or another. Either through purchasing more assets or any other way.

Now, we all know it pretty well that this trend is being exaggerated by the low-interest-rate environment that's present in the current developed markets. People are being forced to participate in the market in the hunt for return.

Also, almost every investor from every country seems to be more interested to participate in the US stock market, even more than their home markets. And the recent trend of commission-free brokerage services and easy flow of capital has helped to provide even more participation in the stock market than usual.

Options trading is also at historic highs and probably most of you buy call options and put options is probably mostly bought by institutional investors(like it always were). As a whole, this frenzy can move the market very quickly.

Remember, SoftBank bought billions in options on very concentrated tech names? That along with retail call options purchasing mania lead the market to a euphoric state. The S&amp;P 500 has become so heavily influenced by those tech names that if they move, the entire market moves. If they fall, the entire market falls.

But we haven't probably addressed a big elephant in the room. Volatility suppression.

Futures traders, algos, our central bank etc all are participating in the dangerous game of volatility suppression. 

This all can unwind though. And it can unwind fairly quickly.

If we take the case of February or March. If you remember, Mr Ackman was screaming fire, fire, fire(he have had his intentions) but the market was barely paying attention.

But with the lockdowns and everything, suddenly everyone seems to have gotten caught with their pants down.

And you know how quick all the things were. Active investors, retail investors everyone suddenly flocked for put options, VIX etc. A Minsky moment has suddenly come.

Margin calls, longs are burnt left and right, market makers have completely turned their positions etc, you know the usual deal but exactly in the opposite direction.

Suddenly gold, treasuries, cryptos etc whatever are being sold to cover their positions. Institutional investors are suddenly visited by their risk managements and they suddenly become net sellers.

Passive investments vehicles also sell stocks that are being kicked heavily.

Literally, everyone's a seller. No one wants to buy. And the situation doesn't change until the Fed comes in and says, ""Brrrr"".

Liquidity suddenly becomes available in the debt market. Retail investors jump. Buy the dip, they said. Money keeps flowing in from everywhere.

There are many other things that I probably needed to say to complete the story. But it is what it is.

Also, interest rate trumps over everything. Every valuation metrics, pricing schemes are dependent on it. So that's super important.

Let's say suddenly interest rates rise the market will immediately collapse along with your meme stock. Because of two main reasons. Every company is loaded with debt and the risk free return has just increased resulting in more money chasing treasury bonds and other instruments.

# These pieces of information any useful?

Yes and no. As they say, hindsight is always 20/20.

Let me tell you my short story navigating the market this year.

February. News of the virus and everything. I see VIX, S&amp;P, bond market, foreign markets etc and I keep sucking my thumb thinking nothing's going to happen. Being burnt by two trades and market starting to freefall almost. I realize my mistake and change my strategy.

Fed says, ""Brrr"". I fail to change my strategy. Something even worse could be coming. Lol. After almost a week passing I realise my f\*\*\*ing mistake. Again. At least I can say it's not just me.

The information is almost always there. Problem is we(not everyone of course, some of you are much more flexible) fail to act upon it. 

Ok, one more story about an individual stock.

Remember AAPL's third-quarter earnings result? I sold calls before earnings thinking the stock will go down after earnings report.

There was overwhelming evidence that this is not going to be true. And I read almost all of it (WFH and everything). Yet my monkey brain somehow decided to trust the analyst estimates and the overall news cycle surrounding the economy.

AAPL then reported a literal blow away quarterly earnings report.

For me 2020 was a year of reckoning and I learned to remove my directional assumption from the market and to just go with the flow. But I am pretty sure it wouldn't matter, cause when it's time, I just wouldn't remember.

To keep it short, (hahaha fuck Melvin) basically GameStop has a partnership with Microsoft, gets a percentage of digital game sales, and other digital purchases, if the console was purchased at GameStop. That means that all these new consoles that just keep on selling out at GameStop, will keep generating revenue for years to come, even if customers don’t come and buy games. 

TL;DR GameStop can still capture digital sales through partnerships.

Discovered first by [Electrek](https://electrek.co) Tesla had updated their website to include the Model Y standard range to start at $41,990 as of yesterday (8/01/21). Cheaper price does mean slightly lower range (244 miles (standard range) compared to 326 long-range version) 244 is still a no-brainer for the price, out-driving Audi’s e-tron ($81,000 with 239-mile range), Nissan and BMW’s electric vehicles for literally half the price. 

July last year Musk tweeted that the “standard range” Model Y would not be produced because its range &lt;250 is “unacceptably low”. 
They are now taking orders for the standard range Model Y’s at the cheaper “standard range” price as of this week.

New 7-seat version of Model Y is now on offer according to their updated website.

Model Y is quoted by Musk to hit Australia in Q4 2021",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktit01/tsla_to_sell_model_y_at_9k_cheaper/,,1/9/2021,3:22:38,10:22:38 PM,22:22:38

Facebook and Twitter censored opposition and told them that if they didn't like what they were doing they could use other sources. When they finally had enough censoring and blatant disregard for the 1st amendment, they moved to Parler. Now they have taken that from the people. This censorship stinks, where they control the media completely. It's time to uninstall all Google and Apple apps. Ditch the devices that run them.

I started swing trading for shits and giggles and was extremely successful.

Then I found options, more extreme gains, still successfull.

I follow the wsb autist method of 100% portfolio in 1 or 2 companies so my question comes down to,
I lost everything doing options because I made a simple mistake, I learned from it and I took a break and came back, so I'm scared to try options again but I feel like I'm conscious of the mistake.

Or should I go back to my swing trades where I may not make thousands a day but I can at least have something left to have to.

Yeah I get it, we have had a rough and painful fucking week. Every orifice we have has been smokefucked relentlessly by Melvin and his circle jerk penises hiding in suits. It hurts, but the bleeding will stop. Now suck it the fuck up. It's time to pack some gauze and toilet paper. Put your helmets and retard safety gear on because Ryan Cohen has us swaddled in his arms.

For all you raisin brains working your double fast food shifts and lacking the time to watch Ryan Cohen's twitter like the fat kid eyeing the last 5 donuts in your Krispy Kreme box, I have your back.

As we all know, a great leader doesn't show face 24/7, but they do come around when you are bent over backwards getting pillaged into oblivion by Melvin's STD riddled uvula puncher in a dark alley behind a Waffle House. This time is no different. Our savior Ryan Cohen just told all you dimwit-fell-off-the-shortbus-smooth-brains to strap in for a ""fun ride."" I went ahead and took a break from half chub jerking off to my friend's TESLA gains to reverse image search this high quality piece of treasure.

Massive Membrane Ryan Cohen took some time out of his day to search roller coaster memes and found this one. We have been instructed to ""keep arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times"". This isn't just some numbing gel to soothe the pain of our torn open and prolapsed assholes. ICR conference is next week and I know some of you weak handed semen squirters hopped on the ride and chickened out at a fucking loss, right before it started. You left your dignity in the same bathroom that you threw your shit-stained underwear. We are gonna go on the ride of a lifetime with enough action that you'll finally have something relatable to tell your wife's boyfriend. It's one that will make your chump pump inflate so explosively that you'll feel a sharp tug on your butthole.

Yesterday was everyone but us (and PLTR, sorry guys). Today was Tesla swinging their nuts like vibranium reinforced wrecking balls, knocking every sell wall out like Mike Tyson KO'ing your crippled grandma over the last bit of Chicken Tikka Masala... and everybody else but us again. However, our time to shine is almost upon us. Our balls drop next week and you might even get your first erection. When this rocket starts blasting, you'll go from your first pube to filming your first consensual orgy in record time. (Thanks Melvin for making me point out the sex acts you've forced on us).

For all you cowards that sold out of GME today and made some money. I am still proud. Either hop back in with more than you had before or go make tendies elsewhere and be prosperous. For you other sperm suckers that sold out of GME today at $17.08 because you have weaker hands than a sleeping quadriplegic, I hope you like giving throat jobs at truck stops for pocket change. Lemme do you a favor, if you sold out of GME at a loss and weren't up EOD, don't hop back in or your toilet paper hands will dissolve as soon as this girl starts getting wet and you'll just lose money all over again.

I know Melvin has done some damage and our assholes move like a blown sub and at this point, probably can't even hold in a fart. It's okay, sometimes making tendies causes grease fires and 3rd degree burns. If you want Melvin out of your guts, you better pull your head out of your own poopchute and throw up a ""Do Not Enter"" sign to prevent future mishaps.

At this point, I'm more excited to see Melvin capitulate into a ball of wrinkly old man writhing in despair and loss, than I am to see green dildos on my screen. Regardless LOAD UP THE FUCKING ROCKETS AND LIGHT SOME CANDLES BECAUSE IT SMELLS LIKE BITCH IN HERE. IF MELVIN WANTS TO STICK HIS ONE DROP WONDER PLUNGER INTO GME'S CHILI RING, P-UMP IT AND SQUEEZE THAT SHIT CLEAN OFF!!

1610152847,21,0,FALSE,1610153428,3,"Yes, yes. There are 5 other Tesla threads up on the front page. This one is marginally different. 

* **SUMMARY**
- 

This week: Tesla hit a market cap of 834B; is worth more than the next top 10 auto companies in the world combined; is up 25% this week, up 107% the past 3 months, and up 838% YoY; and Elon Musk is now the richest man in the world -- the fastest rise up to the top in history by several orders of magnitude. Oh and on 12/31, some dude made a trip from SF to LA in a Tesla with zero interventions. It was in perfect conditions, but that's indescribably impressive on a consumer-grade vehicle. 

What does Tesla's valuation mean? For starters, if starting today Tesla took nearly 100% control of the sales of passenger auto vehicles in the world for the next 20 years, its current valuation would *still* be barely justified. That may seem like a ridiculous deduction even in its hyperbolic form, but Tesla vehicles have low margin. If every vehicle had a battery, batteries would be more expensive, and thus have a lower margin (including efficiency upgrades). Most of Tesla's current profits come from carbon tax credits that other auto companies purchase, so we can't really use their current margins as Tesla can't sell credits to auto manufacturers that don't exist. 

* **NAPKIN MATH**
- 

Let's assume the following: 

1. Tesla is the **ONLY** major auto manufacturer in the world -- putting its production of passenger vehicles at roughly 60MM/year 

2. It has above average P/E ratios for an auto company 

3. It has normal profit margins for an auto company 

**To justify a market cap of 834B as the only auto manufacturer in the world, we'd need the average Tesla vehicle sold to be worth roughly $35,000.** 

Seems pretty doable, right?! Well, this is for the entire world. The average vehicle cost in the United States is a a bit less than $40,000. And the United States spends more per car than any other country in the world. Tesla would need to start producing some real beater $5,000 Teslas to penetrate the Indian, Chinese, African, South American, and European markets. This also has the horrible side effect of massively raising the average price of their cars sold in the United States. We really get the short end of the stick here in the States if Tesla takes over the world! 

Despite controlling effectively 100% of the world's auto market, Tesla's valuation still seems unfathomable. Right? 

No! Okay maybe. But let's take into account some napkin considerations. 

* **NAPKIN CONSIDERATIONS**
- 

Alright, so Tesla still isn't worth 834B despite making almost every single car sold in the entire world. But what about.. 

* ✨ Artificial Intelligence ✨ 

The issue with the AI proposition is that a world with fully autonomous cars is simply a world with *less* cars. If we can get around with cars that drive themselves and don't need parking, we would have a world with no parking garages, less cars, and maybe one parking garage per house, if that. There would simply be fewer vehicles on the road, and thus fewer vehicles sold to people. 

But what about.. 

* ✨ Artificial Intelligence ✨ in commercial trucks? 

This is actually a game changer! But it's not happening in the next 20 years due to safety and worker regulations for truck drivers. Sorry, this is actually one of my specialities. It will absolutely be in our future eventually, but not *well* after consumers fully adopt AI passenger cars. And by then, we'd see more-or-less wider adoption of AI software apart from Tesla.

* **NAPKIN CONCLUSION and TL;DR**

I'm not sure if Tesla is worth 834B, but it was fun to do this. :) Enjoy. I wrote this on the toilet and my legs are asleep now.

**BUY THE DIP!**

**THE TREND IS YOUR FRIEND!**

$CMC was downgraded today to HOLD by Deutsche and then it dumped.

I disagree with their opinion - HIGHLY DISAGREE.

They then upgrade $X and it moons.

Upgrades are great, but you have to take downgrades with a grain of salt, especially by a bank that is upgrading a competing US steel stock on the same day. . .what are they holding?  What do they want to buy?

It smells a little suspect, but that's why you do your own research.

Anyhow, on to the real news of the day that reversed the market and that was Biden's press conference and he laid out that he would be announcing his economic package next week.

 ""Biden is also likely to push for a larger legislative effort later in 2021 after the initial stimulus package. **That effort is expected to focus on spending trillions of dollars on infrastructure** and clean-energy jobs.""

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/08/biden-stimulus-plan/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/08/biden-stimulus-plan/)

The market instantly reversed and steel started recovering, quickly and by the AH action, I believe we are **PRIMED FOR A BIG WEEK COME MONDAY.**

What really stood out to me today was this as well:

Everyone that has read my posts know **$MT is my favorite play.**

The doubters in the beginning (and still - I do get your DM's - lots of angry people out there!) said this was a pump and dump.

$MT popped and then went sideways for a week or so - I said to wait and be patient.

That patience has started to come to fruition.

These increases are immediate and will be taken and like Oliver Twist - customers will say, ""please sir, I want some more""

$MT: ""More?!?!?""

$MT: No problem, it's another $50/ton""

Customer: ""Please sir, I want some more""

$MT: ""More?!?!""

$MT: Sure another $100/ton and it will ship in June, oh and by the way, you'll have to pay extra by then because your price is now the price we agreed upon and adders, so PRICE TIME OF SHIPMENT.

By the way, that is becoming common-place in the steel industry today.

NOTICE HOW THE PRICE INCREASES ARE **RETROACTIVE??!!**

This is becoming common-place and this is how steelmakers ENSURE their margins in markets where raw materials are running faster than they can buy them.

This is part of my thesis as to why these companies are going to show INCREASED REVENUE and most importantly - **INCREASED PROFITS.**

Also, those that believe in what's coming and understand the value and dynamics in the market made some shrewd moves and **BOUGHT THE DIP!**

""
For everyone switching to TD Ameritrade today after being fucked over by RH you should know that there definitely IS instant deposit with TD Ameritrade.

You have to download the actual TD Ameritrade app (I have not tried using the ThinkorSwim app)!

Go to the 'More' tab on the bottom far right, then go to 'Contact us'.

From there hit the message bubble next to 'Need help with your account?'. That will open an iMessage window.

Once there, type in ""Fund account"". It will ask you to click a link to login to TDA on Safari then you can come back to the iMessage and it will ask you to click on a 'Deposit Menu'. 

Click on the 'Deposit Menu' and select the first option which is Apple Pay (Debit Card Deposit) and from there you're good to go! Just keep following the instructions.

TL;DR: TD Ameritrade also offers Instant Deposit for iOS but if you're on Android...R.I.P. I guess. Also, puts on RH!! ""

Also:

For me, for options it took 3 business days for funds to be cleared for use. 

For those fellow autists that binge Adderall and study charts and researching the next moon rocket, there is a metric fuck ton of resources on TD Ameritrade.

Someone recently suggested to Musk that he change his corporate structure to resemble Alphabet. Elon replied positively.

The Plan: restructure $TSLA into a holding company which then acquires, one-by-one and only when the timing is perfect, each of his private companies.  Musk receives a direct cash payout for his share of each private company.

1610148890,80,0,FALSE,1610149513,7,"tl;dr - Pot will be legalized for recreational use, with federal prohibition entirely removed, within the year. Many states are already legal, many more have announced full legalization plans. Local governments around the country are in dire financial straits and this both saves money and generates additional tax revenue. Business goes from ""gray area"" to approved, entering the era of big business and finance getting more involved.  

^(I haven't had the time to research the best valued companies yet so my money is just on MJ calls, $16-20, 2-12 months out, and other ETFs for now...)

It's been surprising to see the weak price action on pot stocks this week after Democrats took both GA seats, not because of any hope but because it's already been solidified that weed will be nationally legal for recreational use this time next year. It looks like a piece of legislation passed on December 4th went under the markets radar.  

The Democratic controlled house has *already* [passed the ""MORE"" act](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2020-12-04/house-approves-federal-marijuana-decriminalization-in-historic-vote) which removes federal prohibition on Marijuana and leaves it to the states. This is significant for many obvious reasons, most important of which is turning a ""gray"" business for (multi-)national companies (e.g financial institutions) into an approved one, which will add fuel to the sectors growth.  

Biden has *already* been certified as the next president of the United States. Both GA runoffs have *already* resulted in Democratic control of the Senate. There is almost no scenario in which weed isn't legalized within the year on a federal level. As I'm sure many of you know, states around the country not only spend huge amounts of money through courts prosecuting these cases, but are also in dire financial straits due to the pandemic. 

Now what can both save money while generating additional tax revenue? Legalization. With federal prohibition removed, many states already allowing recreational use, and many more with plans to, the dominos will start falling. Why would NC give up all this tax revenue to CO, much less when they have multiple connected states with the same options also competing?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kterwl/pot_bubble_20_coming/,,1/8/2021,23:34:50,6:34:50 PM,18:34:50

I don't own TSLA and I don't short TSLA, but I am giving you bagholders some damn good advice. The years of 600% gains are over. With TSLA sitting at a 800 billion dollar market cap, you would need it to hit a 1.6 billion market cap to make 100%. That's not only retarded, I guarantee my magic 8-ball says there will be a correction before that ever happens.

Ended up with +$332k trading p/l last year, well above my goal of $300k. Awesome. 

This year I am shooting for $100k a quarter. In assuming not all weeks will be like this one (can’t stage a coup every week), but my long term expectation is for $5-8k a week. 

Working with about a $500k book, Can lever it up to $2-3mm. 

This week was mainly waiting for outsized moves either direction and playing for mean reversion (macro based for like 70% of the p/l). 

Monday -$32k
Tuesday +$54k
Wednesday +$20k
Thursday +$10k
Friday +5k

Total p/l $57k. Goal is $400k this year.

1610142557,80,0,FALSE,1610143052,7,"Hey there, 
Some of you might recognize my name. I made this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jdkjvc/carnival_is_free_money_dd_inside/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) back in October, where I made the claim that Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL) would make the jump from $14.02 to $15 within a month and up to $20 by January. 

My DD was absolutely correct, on the backs of a market which has been slowly getting desensitized to COVID and that my belief in vaccines were going to come out sooner than most people predicted. Though I made the estimate that we would have a vaccine prior to the election, I did state that it would be out “before the end of the year” which was correct. 

Despite my DD, which was flawed in certain areas (and other things were included to catch some people who wouldn’t have seriously considered the DD in the first place, which was the CCL boat saving people drowning in the ocean) it was completely correct. The problem with WSB is y’all see things in white and black. Either “it can’t go tits up” or “it can only go tits up.” You measure your gains in losses by the thousands, and if there is no “guarantee” of one or the other, it must instantly be a failure. 

Since the time of my DD, Carnival has jumped nearly 30%. So, this is the time when I post all my pictures of my massive gains, right? Wrong. 

My instincts were right, my DD solid, and my money in the right places. However, I second guessed myself into selling at only a $50 profit, when I could have made THOUSANDS on my calls and stocks. 

The conclusion? Take critique to your DD but your principles and fundamentals are important, and do not trust the critique of random WSBetards who use fancy words to make it seem like they know what they’re talking about.

1610141777,64,0,FALSE,1610142251,6,"GOOG is a C class stock without voting rights and it doesn’t pay dividends, and they said that they will not pay them in the future. The company explicitly said in its 2017 annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that ""we intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future."" Google states the ""par value” (the amount Google owes you for the stock) of each GOOG stock is 0.001$ US Dollars. Yet each stock is sold at 1700$ in the stock market.

Why does one buy a GOOG stock? To make money. But since GOOG doesn’t pay dividends, the only way to make money is by selling it to other investor at a higher price. But that investor is buying that stock from the first to also make money, by selling it to others at a higher price. And if everyone is buying GOOG stock to sell it to someone else at a higher price, then what real value GOOG stocks have?

If you come to Alphabet Inc, and show them your 1700$ stock and told them to repay it, they will pay you 0.001$ US Dollars.

So the only way you can make money, is by taking money generated by new investors.

Definition of a Ponzi Scheme: “A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam which generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors. Ponzi schemes eventually bottom out when the flood of new investors dries up and there isn't enough money to go around. At that point, the schemes unravel.” So if GOOG is a ponzi scheme, when do investors dry up and the scheme is unraveled like other Ponzi schemes? The unraveling gets hidden, because It is masked as a bubble burst.

When the new investors stop buying stocks, last investors holding that stock cannot sell them at a higher price and the price of the stock crushes, we call it a bubble burst.

If GOOG doesn’t give any money to its investors, and only source of money for investors are new investors, than it’s a zero sum game. Like a gambling game with other people, but with fees attached to be able to play at a casino, in this case Google.

But it isn’t advertised as a gambling, GOOG is advertised as an investment by Alphabet, making clueless investors buy GOOG stocks, not knowing that its just a zero sum gambling. This is at the edge of criminality. I don’t even know how is it legal.

The simple truth is, GOOG is a Ponzi scheme, being advertised as an investment, when in reality it’s a zero-sum gambling game where the winners are those who sell them first before others, and if everyone knew that it was a zero sum gambling, GOOG stock price would crush right now and no one would want to buy it anymore. This is outrageous.

1610140255,40,0,FALSE,1610140751,8,"* Elon chan has supplanted Bezos as the richest bro in the universe. This makes all quants who kept yapping about how TSLA pricing action via option gamma squeeze will subside once it's included in S&amp;P screech in horror. Who knew the meme stock can continue its action unabated? TSLA hits ATH almost everyday this week, closing Friday up 7.84% to $880. Unreal.

* For a succinct difference of Elon chan's prowess vs Bezos, refer to chart below:

Elon | Bezos |
:---------|:----------|
Hot [goth gf](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3a/f1/d6/3af1d61d443906cb37f5ef92d34412b1.png) who will do kinky shit for him | Traded hot milf for botox lady so he can have dirty shit done to him |
Regularly flies astronauts to the fucking space station with his rockets that can fucking land themselves | Have to keep selling AMZN shares to fund his shit space company that's still dicking around with suborbital flight |
Talks about new gigafactory and everyone wants to give him sick tax breaks to build in their city/state | Shops for new second HQ to give high paying white collar jobs but AOC and gang gets up on his ass in asking for tax breaks |

* Morning economic numbers: nonfarm payrolls once again looking terrible, with consensus at about 50k increase but instead saw a -140k Dec. This ends a 7-month streak of steady gains in recovery. No worry fam, if you've lived thru March 2020 lows you'll know that market doesn't give a fuck about employment #s until you go all-in on calls. US reports more than 4k covid deaths for the first time ever - refer to above on why market doesn't give a fuck.

* Flurries of behind-the-scene political actions are happening as the country moves on from Y'all Qaeda's storming of the capitol. A number of high-level admin officials from policy advisors to cabinet members have bailed the sinking ship that is this current administration. Chatters of invoking 25th amendment. Second impeachment. POTUS has stated that he will NOT attend the upcoming inauguration (who knew he's a gdamn snowflake?), after finally putting out a statement that an orderly transition will occur. 

* Psuedo-SJW social media companies and platforms have banned POTUS in tandem, conveniently doing so after the Dems have clinched both chambers of Congress and will likely sit on committees regulating them. No real movements from these actions yet, though TWTR is pulling back after it banned POTUS for 12 hours until he deleted the offending Tweet. TWTR closed the day down -1.62% to $51.48, after an intraday low of more than -2%.

* BA got a slap on the wrist with a 2.5 bil fine from the DOJ for killing non-Americans. About 10% of the fine goes to the US govt while about 500 mil goes to the families of the 346 people that died in the two 737 Max crash. Remaining (70%) amount goes to BA customers because let's face it, corporations are truly the ones really hurting. BA closed down -1.32% to $209.

* It's a solid day for many Chinese ADRs as as BABA and TCEHY escape Treasury's list of delisting stonk. BABA closed up 4% for the day at $236 while TCEHY closed up 5.61% to $76.89. NIO, the TSLA of China (or is it XPEV? or LI? find out in 1.5 years!) closed up big at 8.55% to almost $59, despite offering to sell 68m more shares last month at $39. Surely the US market isn't going to be China Hustled.

* Today's big movers: DDD and PLUG continues their wild rocket moves to the stratosphere as strong market sentiment continues. DDD closed up 2.48% to $23.54, after touching an intraday high of almost 10% earlier. PLUG closed up 13% to $53.78.

* PSTH, Ackman's brainchild SPAC flew almost 12% today on ZERO news but faded towards end of the day. PSTH gang collectively jizzed and made a mess of themselves. Will it be Stripe? (it's not) Chick-fil-A? (it's not) Bloomberg? (eh they sorta denied it) Subway? (please god no). Find out eventually sometime Q1 2021 as Bill continues to edge us. Seriously Bill, announce something amazing already because I'm up more than 20k on zero news and I'm tempted to sell. PSTH closed up 7.24% to $29.32.

* In WSB meme stock land, a new law is being formed where none of these gdamn stock can go up together on the same day. PLTR faded to flat of 0.80% after being up more than 3% during early mornings, whereas GME and MT both fade some more today after a decent run-up attempt this entire week. GME close the day down -2.16% to $17.69, while MT pulls back from a week's worth of solid gain at -2.7% to $24.83. WSB's new meme ETF ICLN had some profit taking happened much to the displeasure of people who fomo into the ETF this morning, not realizing the sea of red candles were not bullish indicators. ICLN close the day down slightly to -0.75% to $33.15. Funny enough, OTM monthly calls haven't pulled back that much due to the magic of IV.

* While initially red through out most of the day, the DOW reversed course and closed up 0.18% or 56 pts, S&amp;P up 0.55% or 20 pts, Nasdaq up a solid 1% or 134 pts, and RUT closed flat at -0.25% or -5 pts. It's the weekend and WSB newcomers addicted to FDs will no doubt flood the weekend thread, constantly asking if their $700 portfolio (funded in part by the $600 stimulus) with OTM calls will be okay. Don't worry new fam, stonk only goes up.

As I asked her about PS5 and Xbox sales she said they were backordered into the summer. This was also, just the store's online orders. They only got 4 of the next gen systems for launch. I then went to GNC next door to meet up with my Chad bro and tell him my DD. At this point, the GNC guy proceeds to tell me a story about how he went to Gamestop during pre-orders for receipt paper (apparently GNC is having massive supply issues) and that he somehow managed to be in line perfectly to be put on the pre-order list for a next gen system. He was the ninth person in line per his words.

TL;DR GNC is bankrupt and gamestop has enough paper to give away to other struggling retail.

This prompted me to check out Gamestop's online store and sure enough, they have no PS5's or Xbox's anywhere. Heck, even the Nintendo switches are nearly sold out. I think Cohen is doing a good job leading GME into e-commerce and I highly doubt the stock can go much lower from where it currently is because of the huge $17 support right below the current price.

Papa is going to Mars. Now ask yourself why that is. Is that purely because of benevolence or are there business reasons for it? Well, now you might think... if we have Mars colonies, humans are still gonna do the dirty so eventually there will be new customers there. And you couldn't be more wrong.

Remember, Elon 10Xes himself everytime. Tomorrow its Mars, the day after its the next solar system, the day after that its the next galaxy. Now, math isn't my strong suit. But what is the probability that we discover new species (read: new customers)?

Do you just exist as a flourescent bacteria in a pool of primordial ooze? Flash twice to enter into a futures contract with Tesla where you pay for a fraction of the price now, and your evolved descendants will get the best available Teslas once they have a pair of arms and legs.

Are you at a hunter-gatherer stage of evolution? Skip domesticating horses or whatever you got there, and go straight to exchanging ivory tusks for Teslas. Save your planet from the evils of industrialization as a side win.

1610138558,54,0,FALSE,1610139051,2,"Summary
Nano-X has made a range of claims concerning their cold cathode X-ray technology on their site, in interviews, and in a recent demonstration at the Radiological Society of North America.

As a PhD physicist and patent attorney, I am in a good position to analyze the technical aspects of these claims and the Nano-X patent portfolio.

I restrict myself in this piece to the technical aspects of the Nano-X cold cathode and do not treat other issues that have been raised (e.g. CEO track record, sales partners, FDA).

From the available evidence, the Nano-X tube does not appear to have any demonstrated nor potential relevant technical advantages over existing technology. Long term, our forecast is pessimistic.

The valuation of Nano-X (NASDAQ:NNOX) is amplified beyond its intrinsic worth. I believe a close look at the website, interviews, and promotional material of the company reveals consistent overstatement of their case and disingenuous conflation of issues of technical import, to give the erroneous impression of a breakthrough technology.

Nano-X is using a 'cold cathode' X-ray tube, where the heated filament of the standard X-ray tube is replaced by a set of nanometric pointed tips, which release electrons at room temperature and relatively low voltage. This difference, which conceivably might be leveraged for competitive advantage in certain situations, does not appear to be useful in the context of medical imaging. On Nano-X's 'Our Tech' page they have listed a series of purported advantages deriving from their cold cathode, which we address in order, after which we look at a few more issues of interest.

Rapid time switching
In a hot cathode, the acceleration of the electrons towards the Anode ‎‎‎(thereby creating X-rays) is done by activating and switching a high voltage supply. This process ‎‎takes time (on the order of milliseconds). ‎In a cold cathode, one can set the high voltage and ‎switch only the gate voltages - a process ‎that can take only microseconds.‎

•	It is not clear how this is relevant to medical imaging; millisecond turn-on and turn-off times are quite sufficient even for the frame rates of a full body CT, which reaches at most tens of frames per second. Blur can be a problem due to the rapidly moving CT mechanism but it appears the limiting factor here is not the turnon/turnoff time but rather the amount of illumination possible to deliver in the short timeframes available (e.g. 50ms less the turnon/turnoff time for a 20fps device). And as we stress below, Nano-X is not making a CT machine.
•	NASA has developed a sub-nanosecond 100keV Xray source thousands of times faster than the Nano-X device.
•	All the other cold cathode vendors (see 'Unique Positioning' section below) will enjoy the same (but quite possibly irrelevant) fast turnon and turnoff.
‎‎Rapid intensity change / independence of current and voltage
The Field Emitter current depends on the applied voltage, and the X-‎ray intensity depends ‎on ‎the Field Emitter current. With cold ‎cathode technology, it is possible ‎to uncouple these ‎two ‎parameters, i.e., the current's power is independent of ‎the voltage. ‎‎Thus, the X-ray intensity ‎can be rapidly controlled by increasing the speed ‎of switching or by ‎creating ‎short pulses.‎
This is a somewhat confused statement given that the cold cathode technology uses field emitters while the 'hot cathode' uses thermionic emission. If the claim is that for field emission, intensity depends on emission current which in turn depends on applied voltage, then these parameters are by definition dependent - but then Nano-X goes on to claim these are independent. So let's assume for the moment that the statement should actually claim that for the thermionic source, voltage and current (and therefore intensity) are dependent, while for field emission these are independent.
In passing we note that the title of this section on the Nano-X page 'Rapid intensity change', seems to have nothing to do with current-voltage independence which is the actual subject of the section. While we're at it, ""the current's power"" is a clumsy terminological misstep (current [having units of amperes], and power [Watts] being rather different quantities) eliciting pained winces from the technically conversant.
 Source: Nano-X
The graph above from Nano-X's site shows that currents I_a and I_g are independent of acceleration voltage past about 10kV. If we assume that I_a is anode current (which is proportional to emission current and X-ray intensity) and I_g is gate current, then indeed the field emitter current is independent of acceleration voltage (and we note that whoever produced this graph forgot to use a negative exponent for his/her current units).
However, this is largely the case for thermionic emission as well, see graph below. The graph shows the anode current I_a as it depends on acceleration voltage U_a, for a series of different filament currents I_f.
Note that the Nano-X graph shows a current of I_a=0.01A (10mA or 10^-2A) which on the graph below lies squarely in the region of constant anode current with varying acceleration voltage.
 Source: IAEA Diagnostic Radiology Physics Handbook, p. 95
Even if this were not the case, the fact remains that with control over both filament current and acceleration voltage, any cathode-anode current (proportional to X-ray intensity) can be reached for any given acceleration voltage. One can think of it like this : the X-ray operator has two knobs (acceleration voltage and filament current) and by spinning these knobs, can reach any point in the I_a-U_a plane.
‎‎Colder Mechanism
Electrons are extracted from the metal cathode by an applied electric ‎field‎, while the emitter ‎temperature ‎is significantly lower than that of Hot ‎Cathode (thermionic ‎‎emission) filaments. Hot cathode temperature is ‎over 2000 degrees Celsius while a Cold ‎‎Cathode‎ temperature is that of ‎room temperature‎.‎
And, from a Motley Fool interview:
The typical technology requires a massive machine, because it has to manufacture a lot of heat (up to 2,000 degrees Celsius), and then cool itself down. The Nano-X device... distributes this task of creating electrons across 100 million digitally controlled nanocones. That's what makes this X-ray a lot smaller, and a lot cheaper to manufacture and maintain.""
It doesn't appear that Nano-X has in fact found a way around heat production at the anode; they do avoid heat production at the cathode since there is no heated filament. But the heated filament of a conventional tube is a relatively minor energy input (30-150W) into the entire heat load of e.g. ~100KW in a CT tube, while for low power/intermittent use tubes, these heat loads are inconsequential in any case. A Nano-X device of a given power must still reject the same amount of heat as a conventional tube, since it generates X-rays by the same inefficient process of braking radiation (1% X-rays, 99% heat). As is clear from their figure (below), the Nano-X cold-cathode tube is identical to the conventional hot-cathode tube except for the cathode and therefore will have the same heat rejection issues as a hot cathode tube of the same power.

4. Longevity/Lifetime improvement/Filament Burn
The ‎hot ‎cathode's longevity is ‎of thousands of patients' lifetime, ‎whereas that of the Cold Cathode‎ ‎is &gt; ‎‎1M patients' lifetime.‎
If true, this would be great, although it is somewhat offset by the fact that the tubes are also supposed to be cheap. The Nano-X tube lifetime has not been demonstrated in any publications including the Nano-X patents. In any case, replacing $100 tubes a few times a year vs. a few times a decade would hardly make a difference to the overall operating costs.
Beyond this point, current CT tubes, which have the most demanding requirements (being high-power devices) have a lifetime expectation of 10,000-40,000 hours operation, enough for hundreds of thousands of patients. For a $150,000 tube this would work out to a few dollars per patient for tube replacement. And Phillips for one has implemented a 'Tube For Life' guarantee rendering the point doubly moot.
5. Cost
A key Nano-X claim is that their $100 tube replaces a $150,000 CT tube. As detailed here this is an apples-to-oranges (or perhaps grapes to watermelons) comparison of the ~100W Nano-X tube to a ~100kW CT tube having a thousand times the power.

This comparison is repeated in the Nano-X RSNA demonstration and is perhaps the most clearly troubling indication that Nano-X is overstating its case.
Note that Nano-X hasn't developed an Xray detector, only a source. The Nano-X.Arc appears to use the Exprimer DRTECH detector or similar below the table in their latest videos, thus the entire device will have to be at least the $40k-50k price of the detector, belying the Nano-X claim of a total $15K production cost for their device.
Efficiency
High efficiency due to sturdy gate design.
It's unclear what this might mean; Nano-X relies on the same highly-inefficient process of braking radiation as regular tubes, with 99% of the energy going to heat and 1% going to X-ray production.
Uniformity and Stability
These are minimum requirements for a usable device, and do not appear to signify improvements over extant hot-cathode technology, which is also uniform and stable.
Power Management
Supply of less than 50V is required to activate electron ejections from the chip and enable voltage-independent current.
The control electronics for a 50V gate are indeed somewhat simpler than that required to switch a 50kV source, but suitable AC-DC power supplies were available in the 1950's, and a later generation of high-speed switching has been available since the 1980's.
The independence of current and voltage was treated above.
(IN)advisability of yearly scans for early detection
One screening for each symptomatic patient every year.
Using Xray for early detection has a drawback, namely that Xrays carry some degree of cumulative exposure risk. The more scans you have, the more likely you will get cancer.
David J. Brenner, PhD, director of Columbia University's center for radiological research put it this way: ""If you start at age 45, and have them [full body CT] annually until you are 75, you are talking about a one-in-50 chance of radiation-induced cancer, which is a huge risk. Until the benefit is clear, there is not much of an advantage to having routine body scans yearly or even every two years"". Obviously, routine screening for risk groups is a different matter.
Intellectual Property
From a Nano-X SEC report:
As of July 8, 2020, we had three issued patents in the United States and eight provisional or pending U.S. patent applications. We also had three patents issued in each of Israel, Japan and China, three pending patent applications in the European Patent Office, three pending patent applications in Korea and six pending Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications, which are the counterparts of our U.S. patent applications...We intend to continue filing for patents on new technologies as they are developed and to actively pursue any infringement upon our patents. We believe that our know-how and trade secrets represent de facto barriers to potential competition.
However, a detailed analysis of the Nano-X portfolio does not show that they are in a strong position in terms of patents. None of the 13 patents studied show any particular breakthrough in dealing with known problems of nano Spindt emitters (current uniformity, lifetime), and none show any experimental work beyond simulations. Several other companies operate in the digital X-ray source space as detailed below.
Unique Positioning
The Spindt array was patented in 1970, and a number of companies have developed variations thereof for X-ray imaging. There are number of systems currently for sale using digital sources either using small numbers of macroscopic Spindt emitters, or carbon nanotubes as emitters. Carestream, Vec Imaging, Micro-X and Adaptix are all active in the digital Xray source space, with FDA-approved devices for sale now.
Multispectral Magic
Nano-X CEO Ran Poliakine has asserted in at least one interview that ""because it's digital, it's multispectral. You don't need different machines to do different kinds of imaging."" X-rays, CT scans, mammograms not requiring breast compression, angiograms and fluoroscopies have all been claimed as within the purview of the Nano-X Arc due to this multispectral operation.
However, the spectrum (range of energies) of X-rays produced (by both cold cathode and hot cathode sources) is almost entirely determined by the 'braking radiation' process wherein high energy electrons hit the metal (usually tungsten) anode and release X-rays. The spectrum has a characteristic form as shown below.
 
Source: Sprawls Educational Foundation
Here the intensity vs. energy (aka the spectrum) is shown, with a broad braking-radiation (aka 'brehmsstrahlung') curve and several peaks due to atomic transitions (aka 'characteristic radiation'). The point is that there is a wide spectrum produced by braking radiation, which is the process occurring in regular 'hot cathode' tubes as well as the Nano-X 'cold cathode' tubes - so there is no significant difference between the Nano-X spectrum and a regular hot cathode spectrum. In any case the ability to discriminate between different energies doesn't depend on the source (unless it has been filtered to produce only one energy) but rather upon the detector. This ability is very useful (allowing for instance identification of different atomic components of a sample in an EDX-equipped electron microscope) but has nothing to do with the source.
Summary
The Nano-X claims of breakthrough technology do not stand close inspection. Their cold cathode source provides no clear theoretical nor demonstrated benefits over extant X-ray tubes, and suffers from the same limitations. Repeated comparisons of a low power (100W) $100 Nano-X tube to a high-power (100kW) $150,000 CT tube are at best disingenuous, this being only the clearest example chosen from a series of similar sleights.
Were Nano-X to publish a paper or give a demonstration showing that their tube or machine was in some relevant way superior to extant technology, I would gladly stand corrected - being an Israeli citizen I indulge a bit of patriotic pride in the accomplishments of my fellow citizens and suffer an analogous embarrassment at their shenanigans. Lacking such evidence, the Nano-X stock price is a case of 'tulip mania', in which FOMO and hype overwhelm intrinsic value - for the nonce. As Keynes warned in the quote at the head of the article, judging when these two worlds might converge requires a finer analysis than mine.
Perspicacious investors may be interested in Nano-X in light of FDA 501(k) announcements (e.g. in the next few weeks for their single source machine), from which a jump (in a direction comporting with the sense of the FDA announcement) and 'IV crush' may be expected.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ktbamc/nano_x_fraud_nnox/,,1/8/2021,20:42:38,3:42:38 PM,15:42:38

1610138030,12,0,FALSE,1610138521,0,"**Up front, this IS NOT a political post**. I don't care and don't want to hear about your politics in the comments. This post is intended as an example to demonstrate how *degenerates* could ~~gamble~~/invest or legitimately hedge, based on international geopolitics.  

***TL,DR*** *- there's a lightly elevated risk of a crisis in the ME, oil might go up a bit as result, options on oil futures --&gt; Tendies; BUT be careful.*

**So what's the ""play""?**

Buy call option exp mid Feb on CL or other oil future (I'll explain pros and cons of CL below), but ditch at end of the month. Cost currently between 200-300 bucks per contract for a $60 Call on CL.

**Technical considerations and warnings:**

First off, do NOT buy the underlying future unless you know what you are doing, and since you are reading this, you probably don't. The CL future is for 1000 barrels (so quote x 1000 gives you price at the till) for physical delivery at terminal. So if things don't go your way, you stand to lose $1000s and will need to find some tanker trucks fast. Note, because of this, these option contracts are also priced as quote x 1000. So 20c is 200 bucks for the mathematically challenged among you. You know who you are ;).

The options, if things don't work out, will just laps and your max loss is obviously limited to your premium just like with an FD. If things go well, you still need to sell in time though, bc the options settle through to the underlying contract. Some brokers will force you to sell automatically close to expiration.

If you absolutely want to own a future, may I suggest QM, which is for 500 ""virtual"" barrels and thus is settled financially rather than by delivery. But no options available on those.  

**Why not Brent or other crude ""varietals"" instead of CL (which is WTI)?**  

You could, if you broker has the options chain for those. I chose CL for convenience and due to better liquidity usually. No good if you want to exit your contract and nobody is there to buy it from you at a reasonable price.  

**Are there drawbacks to CL over others?**  

Yes maybe, crude is traded based on the fields it comes from and has distinct qualities for each, so it does not move in lock step. Refineries are even calibrated to the kind of crude they can/will process. So an event in the middle east would likely affect local brands stronger than US ones. But you should still see an effect. Just note, when WTI/CL went negative last spring,  Brent was still positive, because the capacity constraints causing the negative excursion did not apply to it.  

**So what makes you think a move is likely?**

Tensions between Iran and the US have been heightened for a while and definitely increased when Soleimani was killed during an air raid last year. A few days ago the Pentagon ordered the USS Nimitz to turn around and head towards the Persian gulf as a warning to Iran. Iran recently voiced personal threats against members of the current administration. Lastly there has been talk in Beltway circles and press that the outgoing administration might want to limit political options vs. Iran for the incoming team by escalating the Iranian issue into a hot conflict.     

**What speaks against your theory?**

In light of recent events, there are moves by Congress to constrain the military authority of the outgoing administration, making last minute actions more complicated. Iran might also hold still, depending on the situation, in the hope of trading short term pain for a reset of relations with the US. The goal there would be to get sanctions relief. Sanctions have escalated domestic tensions in Iran and the regime might want to counter their destabilizing effects.  

So with the above, there are no guarantees, things might go either way, or nothing at all might happen.

**Is there anything else?**

Yes maybe, Saudi Arabia ha recently somewhat unexpectedly cut production quotas to lift the price of oil. One might speculate that pandemic related budgetary pressures (domestically) drove this move, and it could not be the last cut. While this will not make you rich it might help you break even upon exit in case nothing else happens.  

Finally, if there were a conflict, it would most likely lead to a market correction, esp. if there is a large upward excursion in the crude markets. Given that these options are for 1000 underlying barrels, a 10 dollar in the money call would give you a 10k hedge against any (short term) dips of the regular markets.

**Are you invested and are you just pumping?**

Yes and hopefully no. I own one contract currently with no real intention to of getting more. The volatility and prices for oil are driven by forces so much larger that even the combined might of all Robinhood brosefines and brosefs, so would likely not move these things much. Production quotas, global demand and political events that affect either are the dominant drivers here.

**Ok, fine so when should I get out?**

For something expiring mid Feb I'd get out sometime between the 20th and 30th of Jan, since that seems to be the end of this event window. That's my plan at least.

*As usual do your own DD, this is not financial advice, only* *~~gamble~~**/invest what you can afford to lose.*

To be more specific,  CBOE generates a majority of its money through transaction fees. 76% of their revenue is based on their exclusive license agreements regarding S&amp;P 500 Index options (42%) and volatility-based options and futures (36%). And with daily volume in single-stock options averaging17.3 million contracts during 2020, up 68% from 2019, CBOE WILL BE SWIMMING IN MONEY. 

In fact their Q1 revenue jumped by 300 million from Q4 2019, due to the popularity of VIX and associated derivatives during the crash, but have since fallen off as the market recovered and these products were used less.

The company med men has been in a distressed situation, I have been buying their stock over the past few weeks after they posted better than expect earnings. They look like they are on the brink of profitability, and the Illinois stores are the best performing assets. They have yet to open either of their 2 retail license in Boston due to community meetings but the location will soon open near Fenway park. 

This firm is trading at less than $100 million and they are in New York, Florida, Massachusetts, Illinois, Nevada, And California. These are some of the best markets and with the recent turn around under way I feel like this is a perfect opportunity. I have taken a sizable 5 figure position in this stock in the equity. I think it’s very likely we see some form of M&amp;A deal In the next year at higher valuations or another kind of partnership deal that helps solidify the weak spots. 

This is by no means the best and safest play in the cannabis space and you need a real brokerage like E*TRADE or fidelity to buy foreign issues that are also trading at penny stock levels. 

I think the cannabis community or the WSB community could make a move on this play and win beyond expectations. I’m long an you need to do more DD for yourself to take this kind of risk but it’s a great reward and it’s also a hyper growth industry with the senate looking to pass the safe banking act.

1610133006,49,0,FALSE,1610133313,1,"**Hi Retards.** TLRY is the best pot stock and will skyrocket as legalization approaches. **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

**Why is weed the first thing on the agenda?** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Legalization will come a lot faster than expected. Listen to Cuomo

""New York has the potential to be the largest sports wagering market in the United States, and by legalizing online sports betting we aim to keep millions of dollars in revenue here at home, which will only **strengthen our ability to rebuild** from the Covid-19 crisis"" In the same speech, he talked about expanding Marijuana use.

Basically, Cuomo linked sports betting and Marijuana together and has too. Budget deficits due to Corona have destroyed public finances, now politicians have a double incentive. On one hand, they can reduce budget shortfalls by taxing betting and pot, and on the other they get approval from dems. Passing pot laws is a win-win for every politician. It is easy to do and doesn't cost shit. This basically will get top priority.

Market doesn't expect such speed. This is why this is a great play for short and long term gains

**Why TLRY?** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

The merger with APHA will give TLRY a massive cash position. TLRY can legally sell weed in the US, as it's registered, giving them the potential to tap into this HUGE market. TLRY will be a monster in the US AND Canada, making them the largest weed stock by far. For those of you retards that care about fundamentals, they're absolutely amazing when compared to other garbage pot companies.

Analysts expected 50% revenue growth in 2021 BEFORE the senate turned blue. They can easily achieve 100% growth this year if weed is legalized in the first half of 2021 (almost certain). The combined power of APHA and TLRY will give them the possibility to meet customer demand, unlike other stocks that just don't have enough capital to fulfill all the new orders they're gonna get. Estimates give them 17% market share but they don't take the synergies into account, The combined firepower of TLRY and APHA will give them at least 20-22% market share.

The merger will also allow them to sell in EUROPE. This is massively underestimated. Seeing that the US is starting to legalize, Europeans will follow suit. Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Croatia, and others already legalized weed in some form.

**Conclusion** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

The marijuana industry is known for being volatile and, at times, unpredictable. But right now, all signs are pointing to growth.

The political atmosphere in the U.S. has never been more favorable to pot stocks, and we’re seeing the market respond to that goodwill. We’re likely to see that goodwill expand in 2021, which means we can expect marijuana stocks to rise in tandem.

All that comes together to form what is perhaps the most bullish market for pot stocks we’ve seen in the past few years. And it’s likely to get even more bullish.

**TL;DR TLRY HAS A HUGE POTENTIAL THANKS TO ITS MERGER WITH APHA. SYNERGIES WILL HELP THEM MEET NEW DEMAND AND INVADE EUROPE** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

It's a SPAC, Ticker PIPP: Pine Island Acquisition Corp.

It's director's consistent of:

* John Thain, Fmr CEO of Merill Lynch before they merged with BofA
* Biden's pick for Secretary of State - Tony Blinken
* Biden's pick for Secretary of Defense  -Gen. Lloyd Austin

They also have such close ties to government officials,  it needed to include disclose its ""UNUSUAL access to information"" in its Nov. 2020 SEC S-1 Filing

They were also loaded at IPO by:

* Ken Griffin/Citadel own 6.9%
* Israel Englander/Millennium own 5.2%

Basically this is a defense/government service spac that you best believe is going to get a fuckton of contracts under this administration given the secretary of state and secretary of defense are directors.

This is what Palantir wishes it was.

No options, but you can pick up warrants or units and probably make 3x.

1610131074,74,0,FALSE,1610131328,3,"Alright, retards ... time to drop some boomer stock knowledge

Constellation Brands ($STZ), owner of Corona and Modelo beers, is loading up the train to tendie town and you better get your ass onboard. I'm going to completely ignore their premium beer &amp; wine boomer business and focus on why I think this thing is **WAY** undervalued and the best (hidden?) cannabis play around. 

But first, story time...

October 2017: Constellation makes waves with a $191 million investment in Canopy Growth Corp (CGC), Canada's largest pot producer, for a 9.9% stake. This came in roughly 18 million shares of common stock, and 18 million warrants. 

Then weed stocks pretty much pumped and dumped, then floundered in the low single digits

May 2020: Constellation [increases stake](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/constellation-brands-raises-stake-in-canopy-growth-to-38.6-percent-2020-05-05) to 38.6% by exercising those 18 million warrants for roughly $10/sh (12.97 CAD), and puts another $**4 billion** into CGC. In total owning 158 million shares, *ANOTHER* 140 million warrants, and like 150 million of senior debt. \*NOTE\* the warrants from the 10/17 deal were \~33% below market value (CGC was $15/sh on 11/1/17 so using that logic the warrants acquired on 5/5/20 should be roughly the same cost basis since CGC was $15/sh on May 5th).

Fully diluted, they actually **CONTROL** Canopy Growth: ""Collectively, the common shares now increase Constellation Brand's ownership of Canopy Growth to 38.6 percent of the issued and outstanding common shares. Assuming full exercise of all remaining warrants and full conversion of the notes, Constellation Brands would own a nearly 55.8 percent stake in Canopy Growth.""

Pretty fucking sweet, right? Especially in a blue wave US government that could legalize cannabis in the next 2 years of congress control.

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!

July 2020: Constellation [acquires](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisfurnari/2020/07/01/constellation-brands-buys-gary-vaynerchuks-direct-to-consumer-empathy-wines-brand/?sh=7d59f0db4cea) Gary Vaynerchuck's D2C wine business Empathy Wines, showing some pretty outstanding vision considering alcohol delivery is [legal in 34 states](https://abcnews.go.com/US/states-explore-keeping-alcohol-demand-delivery-permanent-covid/story?id=70902208) plus PR and DC. Cutting out retailers should provide a huge boost to operating margins as COVID normalized home delivery for pretty much everything. 

Fast forward to today:

Jan 7th: Constellation fuckin [destroys their ER](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/07/constellation-brands-ceo-on-q3-earnings-high-demand-for-hard-beverages.html): beats EPS by 65 cents. Stock shoots up 7% then settles down around +2-3%

Jan 8th: Constellation gets [a ton of PT upgrades](http://prnt.sc/wj764t) from GS, DB, Cowen, MKM, etc etc. Targets mostly $250-275. 

Current price? $226. And down over 1% today. This is a crouching tiger, hidden tendie bazooka if it goes meme status. Those 140 million warrants should entitle STZ to CGC shares at $10/sh and they're trading at $30/sh today - ***which is probably the biggest hidden value here.*** 

When everyone's favorite drink is a CBD-infused seltzer you'll be drinking yours in a golden chalice for the balls it took to yolo into this boomer stock in January.

1610129561,38,0,FALSE,1610129759,2,"Hey Gang,

Stumbled across an opportunity with Foley Trasimene Acquisition II Corp (BFT) that I thought I'd share with you all. For those who are unfamiliar, BFT is a lower tier meme stock here on WSB. It's a SPAC that [intends to acquire PaySafe](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201207005389/en/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp.-II-and-Paysafe-A-Leading-Global-Payments-Provider-Focused-on-Digital-Commerce-and-iGaming-Announce-Merger), a leading digital payments platform for \~$9B. Paysafe has about $1.5B in revenue and is growing in the eCommerce and online gaming markets. Plus they have a [pretty spiffy investor deck](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-presentation.pdf) full of vague promises of profitability if you take away most of their expenses. Next stop, the moon.

**What's the trade?**

1. Buy BFT shares in blocks of 100 at \~$14.80
2. Sell 10/15/21 $20 covered calls at \~4.75
3. ???
4. Profit

**What do our outcomes look like?**

* Best Case Scenario: BFT goes to 20 or above. We get called on the options we sold and we pocket a $5.20 gain + $4.75 premium for each share, for a return of $9.95 on our $14.80 initial investment per share (67% return in 9 months). We do max out at 67% though if this bad boy really moons.
* Worst Case Scenario #1: Acquisition falls through, BFT shares return towards their liquidation value ($10). We lose on our shares, but since we got that $4.75 covered call premium we're only looking at a loss of \~$.05 / share
* Worst Case Scenario #2: Acquisition goes through and the stock tanks. Theoretical max loss is $10.05 per share (cost basis - premium for covered call), but realistically I think we can assume Paysafe isn't going to zero between now and October. 
* Anywhere in between we're probably making money as our adjusted cost basis is \~$10.05
* So basically it literally can't go tits up. Right guys?

Long 500 shares in BFT, sold 5 $20 10/15/21 Covered Calls

With Vaccines rolling out this stock will 🚀 back. It is still depressed on fears of new variants but everything says the vaccines will work on these new variants.

Canadians love to travel, and many are still finding creative ways around Travel bans. AC has been doing more freight flights and has reduced there cash burn.

Although Robinhood is considered free for investors, it really isn’t free as it makes money off trading through a process called payment for order flow. Here’s how it works: the retail broker passes the order to a high-frequency market maker who pays a fee to the retail broker for the order, often pennies for a trade.

(https://store.wsj.com/shop/us/wsjnonusamss21/?trackingCode=aaqwghsn&amp;cid=WSJ\_RD\_ALL\_ACQ\_NA)

Robinhood attracts the highest rates for equity trades making around 17 cents per hundred trades. For options trading, the disparity is even bigger.

Robinhood is an online broker app with no commission included. With around 13 million customers as of 2020, Robinhood, valued at around $20K, has the opportunity to become one of the top initial public offerings in 2021.

Robinhood can be riskier than traditional stocks, with significant capability for big gains or big losses. For expert traders and investors, Robinhood is not considered the best trading platform due to its limitations. Robinhood is easy to be suggested to novice investors as long as these investors are willing to find research tools and educational resources elsewhere.

According to Bloomberg, Robinhood is considering selling a small part of its shares to its own users and customers before going public this year. There has been no decision made as to how much stock will be sold to its current customers or if it is going to actually go through.

Although the platform seems to be going well for inexperienced investors, Robinhood’s rapid growth has come along with controversies, one of them including a hacking spree that jeopardized around 2,000 accounts. Robinhood is now secured and safe for users. In fact, any money that is transferred to your account is protected by Securities Investor Protection Corporation. (SIPC)

* **Long sellers may have difficulty in producing stock in good deliverable form to their broker-dealer.**

In regards to the SPAC merger alone, SoFi will be valued at 8.65B post merger...IPOE currently has a market cap of 1.92B; so theoretically the stock price should increase based on fundamentals alone.

So, what does SoFi have to do AWS of Fintech...well they purchased Galileo Financial Software in April of 2020. For those of you who know the popular Fintech companies: ROBINHOOD, CHIME, DAVE.COM, MONZO, MONEYLION, TRANSFERWISE; all of them utilize Galileo Financial Software. Galileo powers all of the up and coming fintechs and will continue to be the leader for fintechs.

I ask you fellow WSBers to join me in my quest to make this the new meme stock. 1 thing I forgot to mention about why this will be a meme stock; Chamath Palihapitiya is the one behind the SPAC; others SPACs he’s backed are: SPCE, and OPENDOOR. Lastly, here is what my man said his ambition will be: About Chamath Palihapitiya: “My ambition is to be our generation’s Berkshire Hathaway. It’ll be a Berkshire, a holding company that, instead of holding Gillette and Coca-Cola and McDonald’s, will hold technology businesses,” Palihapitiya told Fortune earlier this summer.

I’m long shares and looking at deep OTM call options. Join me and let’s make a new meme stock",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kt66u8/aws_but_for_fin_tech/,,1/8/2021,16:43:06,11:43:06 AM,11:43:06

1610123265,23,0,FALSE,1610123335,2,"First, to reduce any confusion, the company will be referred to as Papa John's and the person will be referred to as Schnatter.

I was joking about the idea to take over Papa John's with some of my friends yesterday to get Schnatter back in control of his company, and when I started doing my research I actually liked what I saw purely from an investment standpoint. This post will have two main parts: how we can get Schnatter his job back and also how we can easily make money on PZZA. We'll do the money stuff first.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chart**

As of writing this, PZZA is currently trading at $94.10 and the ATH is $102.25. It is basically guaranteed that it will go back to the ATH. It has also sailed past the 20 and 10 day moving average, so there is no resistance until ATH. This is great for options.

https://preview.redd.it/s6klbqs2u4a61.png?width=920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a797b3678678bd167818ee455dcde4d49f6e4512

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, I suspect that PZZA could be forming a cup and handle pattern. If this plays out, the price target would be (ATH + (ATH - Bottom of Cup)), which is about $131.38. However, we won't know if this is a cup and handle until it happens.

https://preview.redd.it/umhvpr1ou4a61.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b468ffd791469758f0679d390c4b6d72cad01a35

Even if the pattern fails, a delivery pizza restaurant is a pretty safe place for your money to be during the pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Numbers**

[Target price](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PZZA/research-ratings) of $104.50 with a high of $116.00. I think this is low going off the chart.

[31 million shares](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) float. I know that's a lot, but Schnatter already owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile).

Guys, it's take out pizza in a pandemic it should really be self explanatory.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now we can talk about how Schnatter can become reinvolved with the company, which should help PZZA stock even more. As you will see, ever since he left the company has not been in as good of a position.

**Why Schnatter Left**

In 2017, he made a controversial comment about how the [NFL player protests were hurting Papa John's sales](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/22/572779230/papa-johns-ceo-steps-down-following-controversial-remarks-on-nfl) because they were the official pizza sponsor of the NFL. I don't want this to get political, but this is essential to talk about. Schnatter stepped down as CEO but remained on the board of directors. Fast forward into 2018, where Schnatter was reported to have [used a racial slur](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2018/07/11/papa-johns-founder-john-schnatter-allegedly-used-n-word-on-conference-call/?sh=376e4e6e4cfc) in a meeting and it was recorded. Then, he stepped down from his position and no longer had a role in the company (besides for shareholder).

&amp;#x200B;

**Schnatter's Fight for Innocence**

Ever since both of these allegations have surfaced, Schnatter has maintained his innocence and that his words were taken out of context. In a [recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA) Schnatter had with the H3 Podcast (I know many people don't care for them, myself included, but those opinions don't change what Schnatter says in the interview) where he explained why both allegations were false. Regarding the NFL drama, Schnatter claims that he was talking about how the NFL had a leadership problem because they were not addressing the issue. [His exact words were,](https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/ex-fbi-director-clears-papa-johns-founder-of-racial-bias-slams-clearly-inaccurate-media) ""*The NFL is hurting, and more importantly by not resolving the current debacle to the player and owner’s satisfaction, NFL leadership has hurt Papa John’s shareholders.""* In regards to the allegations of him using a racial slur, former FBI director Louis Freeh, wrote a [report](https://papajohnschnatter.report/read-the-report) where he explains how that in the phone call where he used a slur, he many times stated how he does not support any form of racism, and when he said the word, he was referring to how Colonel Sanders used it and it bothered him. There are two parts to the recording that Schnatter has been fighting in court to get released. The first part includes him using the slur and the context, and the second part includes the other people on the call celebrating after Schnatter hung up talking about how ""they got him"" and they needed to get it to the press right away. This is all according to the H3 interview. It is common sense that Schnatter would not want a recording made public that would damage him, and the company seems intent on keeping it secret, showing that they are likely hiding something.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sales are Slumping**

[Sales are decreasing](https://www.statista.com/statistics/221441/papa-johns-total-revenue/#:~:text=Revenue%20of%20Papa%20John's%20worldwide%202007%2D2019&amp;text=American%20pizza%20restaurant%20franchise%20Papa,seeing%20a%20decline%20in%20revenue) every year since his role as been minimized. It's as simple as that. They are in no way a failing company, they are just making less money than they were.

*Processing img 934fvr5jq4a61...*

In addition to slumping sales, in the [H3 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYGrUA6YjA), Schnatter claims that Papa John's total number of customers is down significantly and that the quality has decreased. He says he buys about 600 pizzas every 90 days from stores around the country to check on the quality. In my personal experience, I can say the quality at my local Papa John's has decreased over the past couple years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why Schnatter Can Fix This**

Schnatter is more devoted to Papa John's than most CEOs (after Karp and Elon), even though he technically doesn't work for them anymore. As I said before, he does frequent quality checks on the restaurants. The reason he does is is because he cares about the franchise owners and employees who have been negatively impacted by the new management and slumping sales. Who else still puts effort into a company after they've been fired from it? Also, this is just speculation, but since he is still closely associated with the company it is still his reputation.

&amp;#x200B;

**What we can do**

It's simple, buy shares! If we buy enough shares of PZZA, we (along with Schnatter) can become the majority shareholder of the company. There are [just over 31 million shares float](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=pzza) and Schnatter still owns almost [1.3 million shares](https://ir.papajohns.com/stock-information/ownership-profile), or 3.88% of the company. If he can convince a few of the other large investors that it is in their best interest to see him in charge again, we can easily call a shareholder meeting, vote out those who wrongly accused him, and put him, back in charge.

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical Implications**

Schnatter has long been touting ""The Day of Reckoning"" but has not given any hints as to if it has already happened, if it is multiple events, or what it will be specifically. If we can accomplish this, WSB would go down in history (it already has) again for giving a man his company back... and we will make money in the process. We can be the day of reckoning!

&amp;#x200B;

**Is This Legal?**

Yes, it is perfectly legal. This would technically be a hostile takeover, which is legal, but we can just call it something else. Besides, I'm pretty sure Ryan Cohen is trying to do the same thing with Game Stop.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

PZZA chart shows easy money, Schnatter is innocent of accusations, only he can bring Papa John's back to its former glory, and we can be the ones to do that. The Day of Reckoning is here!

We narrow our '20 loss per shareestimate by $0.10 to $0.19 and increase our '21 EPS estimate by $1.86 to $3.11,as we account for the recent surge in steel prices and CLF closing itsacquisition of ArcelorMittal USA (AM USA).

Hang in there. 

It got hotter faster than expected and pullbacks are healthy. 

Buying started coming in on the beaten down stocks today. 

This is a GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO COST AVERAGE. 

Everyone that keeps asking “when is a good entry point?”

NOW

On all steel stocks that are down today. 

Buy the dip. 

You will thank yourself later. 

Rising tides lift all boats and we are closing in on 2008 levels as said by Schnitzer yesterday. 

Also, remember it’s Friday and we have had a barn burner week. 

There will be profit takers. 

Many thought I was full of shit for a couple weeks. 

Then the wave came. 

This is the wave ebbing back before another larger one.

They will likely be announcing the RTX 3000 which will drive the next generation of gaming laptops. Along with announcing the RTX 3080 Ti which will fall in between the RTX 3080 &amp; 3090. There is some hope that Nvidia will take the wraps off of the more budget-oriented Ampere based GPUs so that gamers on a budget can make the jump into the next generation of visuals. There is a chance we could finally see the rumored RTX 3060 and RTX 3050 GPUs that are needed in the sub $200 market.
Everything will be made official on January 12th during the GeForce RTX Game On event.

1610117856,4,0,FALSE,1610117868,1,"Here's how you can make free tendies only limited to how much you want to put in:

2020 was the year of SPACs. If you don't know what a SPAC is, it's basically a blank-check company that allows a sponsor/manager to go and merge with a private company and therefore make them public. Once the target is announced, there is a pop in price because people rush into the SPAC (in some cases, rush out if the target seems shitty). 

Now, here's how to make the tendies. Chamath Palihapitiya is the king of the SPAC. If you need proof, look at his track record. $IPOA today is $SPCE. $IPOB today is $OPEN. $IPOC is becoming $CLOV. $IPOD is not announced yet, $IPOE was announced yesterday (becoming SoFi), and $IPOF is not announced yet either. Go look at the track record. It's flawless. Every one of the announced SPACs is up over 100%. $IPOD and $IPOF are not even announced yet, and they're up a lot already. 

Chamath's plan is to create 26 SPACs, $IPOA-$IPOZ. This is the best part. You can just buy into the SPAC and sell on the pop of the announcement, or if you believe in the SPAC, you can hold it. This man creates diamonds from anything he touches. 

Make him your dad just like I did. You won't regret it. Go get those free tendies lads.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kt413r/free_tendies_by_buying_chamaths_spacs_ipod_ipoe/,,1/8/2021,14:57:36,9:57:36 AM,9:57:36

&amp;#x200B;

Alrighty, so here are my positions.  Note\*:  I already paperhanded 10 - 100 put expiry 2/19 - for a 2k loss

  
1 - 100 put expiry 2/19 - Cost $4 (Already Getting Crushed)  
3 - 120 put expiry 5/21 - Cost $13.31  
5 - 110 put expiry 5/21 - Cost $12.00  


Ok, so here's the little I know...   
1.  DoorDash's market cap is over 50 Bn now.  Which in my IMHO is at least 2x too high.

2.  We are still in lock up period... So, I feel like they are going to dump after that ends in like March.

3.  It looks like SoftBank holds the lion's share of currently tradable shares, and they ain't selling (yet).

4.  In regards to #2-3, this POS was trading sidewise at 140, IMHO trying to burn options.  F\*\*\*ing worked on mine.    
I've never seen anything like this before (Trading for like 3 years, WSB lurker for like 1 yr, and freshly minted member 1 month ago).

5.  I feel like it's going to go back to that 140 range after a short squeeze today, I could probably bale as soon as that happens and break even or even make back a little of the 2k I already lost.

&amp;#x200B;

Ya'll know what I wanna do.  I wanna hold these MFers til I'm riding high in tendie town.   **🚀🚀🚀** 

I don't have any links to the above referenced information because I'm lazy as f\*\*\* and I'm it's 10 minutes til opening bell.  


This my only 🌈🐻 position, and I know Stonks only go up... but, this... and ZM are the only 2 boomer entries I want to short to the ground.

1610114839,15,0,FALSE,1610114851,1,"MicroStrategy—and Michael Saylor—have a chequered past. In 2000, Saylor, together with two other MicroStrategy officials, were [accused of fraud](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/15/business/microstrategy-chairman-accused-of-fraud-by-sec.html) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely reporting massive MicroStrategy profits despite the company losing money, artificially inflating its value. This cooking of the books was picked up on by auditors and is what led to the SEC charges. Ultimately, Saylor and the other two were forced to settle with the securities regulator. Though he did not admit or deny the accusations, Saylor was hit with a $350,000 penalty and was forced to return $8.3 million to shareholders.

The period in which Saylor was falsely reporting MicroStrategy’s profit was accompanied by a similar PR blitz, with the stock seeing an 80-fold increase in value over this time and was lauded as a success story; Saylor promised to contribute $100 million toward the founding of an ‘Internet university.’ These plans never materialized, and Saylor was settling with the SEC within a year.

The company survived the controversy, though it has been the subject of criticism since. The chief investment officer of hedge fund firm Apex Capital called for MicroStrategy to be overhauled, which would include the ousting of Saylor. They complained that the company’s senior staff were ‘not fully engaged in the day-to-day operations of the business or agonizing over inferior shareholder returns’ and, for example, hadn’t held a shareholder conference call for almost 10 years. In a similar vein, Saylor has come under criticism for [racking up massive personal expenses](https://ffj-online.org/2014/06/09/saylor-story/), well in excess of what would be expected even for larger companies.

Greetings my fellow millionaires and bums,

I've been into GME all in for a couple of months now. It has been truly depressing seeing all other stocks, especially hydrogen and renewables, EVs explode this last period while we eat dirt and try to buy every single minor dip on GME. Whilst everyone just rockets sky high and market is up, we are practically the only ones down. Should monday/tuesday be disappointing for GME after the event is done, would it still be worth holding? Honestly throughout this past month portfolio would have exploded if not all of the shares were on GME. I am a wood-handed retard (between diamond and paper), but my wood is starting to collapse inch by inch everyday.

#[Today's Top Headlines for Friday, January 8th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-8-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Wall Street set to continue its record run

&gt; U.S. stock futures rose Friday, one day after the Nasdaq closed at a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 also closed Thursday at records. Both benchmarks were tracking for weekly gains despite Monday’s sharp drops, the first negative starts to a new year since 2016. The Nasdaq was also solidly higher for the week as Wall Street powered higher over the past two days despite Wednesday’s deadly siege at the U.S. Capitol and its fallout.

&gt; Bitcoin, which topped $40,000 on Thursday for the first time ever, passed $41,000 on Friday. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been up more than 30% in the first days of 2021 and 400% over the past 12 months. The value of the entire crypto market, which is made up of bitcoin and other digital coins, topped $1 trillion Thursday for the first time.

&gt; Tesla shares marched higher in Friday’s premarket after rising 10 sessions in a row, surpassing Facebook in market value, and making CEO Elon Musk the world’s richest person. Thursday’s increase in Tesla’s share price pushed Musk past Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who had been the richest person since 2017.

*****

&gt; # 2. December jobs report could be weaker than forecast

&gt; The pace of job growth likely slowed dramatically and could even be negative in December, as the coronavirus spread rapidly across the U.S. Economists expect to see a gain of 50,000 jobs, down from 245,000 nonfarm payrolls additions in November. The Labor Department’s monthly employment report is out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and the stock market could react more to a positive surprise than a negative one. The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% early Friday ahead of that report.

*****

&gt; # 3. Trump finally concedes Biden will become president

&gt; President Donald Trump late Thursday admitted — for the first time in his own words, despite vowing never to concede — that a “new administration will be inaugurated” on Jan. 20. In a nearly three-minute video, posted after his Twitter lockout ended, Trump did not mention President-elect Joe Biden by name. It came a day after the outgoing president sparked the riot that saw a mob breach the U.S. Capitol in protest of the election.

*****

&gt; # 4. Pelosi, Schumer call for Trump removal from office

&gt; Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are calling for Trump’s removal, accusing him of inciting “insurrection.” Schumer said that if Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet do not move to invoke the 25th Amendment, Congress should reconvene to impeach Trump.

&gt; Pelosi said Congress “may be prepared” to impeach Trump if executive branch officials do not act.

&gt; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were among the Cabinet secretaries who discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, three sources told CNBC. They determined the process of elevating Pence to the presidency could take more than a week, diluting its effects.

*****

&gt; # 5. Single-day Covid deaths top 4,000 for first time

&gt; The U.S. had its first day of over 4,000 deaths from Covid-19. In the single worst day of the pandemic Thursday, 4,085 people died from the virus. The latest coronavirus surge iaw record seven-day averages of new daily infections and deaths running at 228,497 and 2,764, respectively. As of Thursday, the number of people hospitalized with Covid fell slightly from Wednesday’s record high levels.

&gt; A coronavirus vaccine developed by U.S.-based Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech appears to be effective against a key mutation in the more infectious variants of the coronavirus discovered in the U.K. and South Africa. The research by Pfizer has not been peer reviewed. The World Health Organization said last month that health authorities were “urgently investigating” whether the virus mutation affects vaccine performance.

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a big rally in the stock market after the [Biden](https://ibb.co/QpPkkvg) confirmation and Trump called for a smooth transition with the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sw8bKdb) recovering the previous day losses and closing at over 13K. We also saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/MnjT8BH) gaining almost 1.5% and finishing over 3800 while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/ykPckZD) also posted a gain of over 200 points to close at just over 31k with all 3 of the big indexes finishing at new records. This broad rally pushed the [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MY0P1w) down, as the volatility index finished the day lower by more than 10% as 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/nmc7x8X) finished in the Green with Technology leading the way up 2.7%, while Utilities was the biggest laggard dropping by 1.3%.

Growth companies largely outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/XpHGdhb) with both small and large cap growth companies posting big gains across the board, while value plays lagged behind, as 2/3 of the companies were advancing [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/NLLMyLY) with over 300 new highs on average volume.

So, let’ take a look at the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ys6zg6M) from yesterday, as big tech companies flourished with the likes of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Nvidia, Tesla and many more posting gains at least 2%, while most of the losses were concentrated in the Chinese stocks that are being delisted and the more value heavy utilities sector.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/10gRPgn), which saw a worrying move in the stock market, as bullish investors surpassed 50% of the total investors and is near the 1-year high from November. Most of this move to the bullish side came from neutral investors, which are way below the historical [average](https://ibb.co/XbyKxjB), which probably decided to get back in the market, rushing in the clean energy sector, the industrials and many others after the Democrats swept the Georgia election. I remind you that I usually use this survey as a contrarian indicator, when sentiment moves to this much greed in the market, I usually don’t like to add to my positions, as I await to buy stocks on red days.

We also received some economic data yesterday, as we saw December’s homes for [SALE](https://ibb.co/7Y3njz3) fall to an all-time low, below 700K as the housing market keeps on booming, with homes selling faster by about 2 weeks compared to last year while the national inventory dropped by almost 40% since last year, as the median listing price was $340K, up over 13% since 2019.

[Today](https://ibb.co/t4bS0wH) is a quieter economic day, with the biggest number coming in the early morning as we wait to see the non-farm payrolls.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Nikola](https://ibb.co/DLP8f1P) joining the broad rally in the EV [STOCKS](https://ibb.co/mJgVqwr) yesterday which pushed almost every single stock higher, while we also saw a report from JP Morgan on some possible good developments on their trucks. I don’t believe in this company, it’s bad history, bad management and reputation will hurt it in the long even if they manage to develop a decent product, which is still to be seen, as they haven’t really brought anything innovative to the market.

One other stock that rose yesterday was [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/FbZZ5Lz), as the stock spiked more than 27% yesterday, after the company was pitched by the Motley Fool yet again. I really like this company, and I think it has major disruption potential in the insurance world, so I agree with this report. The stock did suffer a slight pullback about a week ago after a report from The Friendly Bear but I don’t believe it will have a long-lasting effect, as I believe this stock has great growth potential.

[Apple](https://ibb.co/Xzscpk6) also seems to be confirming the previous reports and is in talks with Hyundai about a development of a self-driving EV, as we heard something about this from Hyundai before some confusion made them kind of back out of the previous statement. This report is pretty much as anticipated, as Apple would probably be looking to either collaborate on manufacturing with a traditional car manufacturer or actually just acquiring pretty much any one of them.

We also saw [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/vZ1v7yw) regain some momentum yesterday, rising by more than 13% despite the expiration period of another 38M shares. The latest IPOs and small-cap stocks have recently been able to raise a lot of capital as investors seem to be grabbing any share available at almost any price regarding valuations. This is a very dangerous thing yet again. This kind of stuff was happening in the last dot com bubble, though… I don’t really expect anything like that to happen with the overall stock market, but I think we might see some stocks have a big crash when valuations start to come back in the mind of investors.

Meanwhile we saw 2 big milestones for Tesla &amp; Elon Musk yesterday as the company [passed](https://ibb.co/yXnFsbp) Facebook as market value goes as Tesla is seeing huge trading volumes as yesterday, it [traded](https://ibb.co/6BYkLP9) more shares than the next 3 big movers Apple, Alibaba and Amazon, while Elon Musk [became](https://ibb.co/xS0G5Sk) the richest man in the world, on the back of a 16% increase in Tesla stock already in 2021.

And two last pieces of good news are that the it’s expected the [FED](https://ibb.co/6FTNrSF) will likely hold rates near zero until 2024 while [Pfizer's](https://ibb.co/6nGSdWR) vaccine seems to be working as expected on multiple mutations, especially the latest highly transmissible one.

So, let’s hope for a good day as the European [markets](https://ibb.co/LdhPq9P) and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wSTgstr) are up to start off the day, with the Nasdaq Leading the way up over half a percent.

Why is the meme power so important?  Why is this sudden late boost in sales so important?

**Because the dusty old millionaire shareholders aren't on social media and have no clue about the true potential because they play sudoku on paper and thus aren't pricing in the coming action.**

I'm not saying that Sam Adam's doing good is gonna be news to them; but every single time the big dollars are aware of a catalyst and possible positive price action change backed by a strong financial quarter, they price that in for options and then our lottery calls are too expensive and risky to play.

The  Indian Steel Association (ISA) calls for a 6 month ban on iron ore exports. India is the fourth largest iron ore producer in the world. [Source](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/features/top-iron-ore-producing-countries/#:~:text=Global%20iron%20ore%20production%20jumped,0.5%25%20for%20the%20following%20decade)

This is just the latest showcase of the massive iron ore shortage the world is facing in the wake of the pandemic. Governments everywhere announced/will announce massive infrastructure plans to spur on the economy.

With India possibly out of exporting, iron ore prices can only go up, meaning other iron ore producers are set to profit massively. The last time iron ore prices where this high VALE was at almost $40 (+100% upside from today)

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img nez2vlopq2a61...*

&amp;#x200B;

VALE is also fundamentally undervalued compared to its competitors, other miners are trading at 2X the EPS of VALE, again confirming our price target of high 30's. The reason VALE stock price is suppressed is an accident last year at one of their dams. VALE is still negotiating a deal with the Brazilian government but expectations are that this will be behind them soon.

Bullish case: 

Flight centres biggest markets are (in order) Australia - America - UK. InAustralia we see no to little community transmissions and a planned rollout of vaccines early March. Without a vaccine there’s been an increase of 200% in bookings in Australia through Flight centre online (and that’s with borders starting to partially open up again) for December and throughout early 2021 with hotel and flights being fully booked out. Australia’s market for flight centre is largely made up of corporate travel, however, that could change momentarily due to lockdown fatigued and people wanting to travel for leisure and go on a holiday (which mind you we already see a huge increase in demand for holidays) and corporate travel likely to come back even in small increments we could see a huge increase in revenue and profits in 2021’s earnings (most likely beating expectations). An increase in profits is and a possible increase in profit margins due to operating cost decreasing and most likely staying at the same level until full operation. This is where it gets tricky though, they are well know for their walk in deals when customers come into the store, but since the recent closing of more than 100+ stores in Australia alone, Flight centre would have to heavily push for online consumption of their products. Which is why some people say Webjet is better placed, but flight centre has a lot of money due to their capital raising, and if they can use the money well and offer online deals, marketing campaigns and still keep open their remaining stores with in store deals. They will have multiple income streams from different infrastructures (unlike webjet). For example, boomers mostly don’t know how to use the internet and would rather face to face because it feels more authentic while the younger generation don’t care which one they use as long as they get discounted cheap prices for fully planned holidays that they themselves after lock down probably can’t be stuffed planning themselves. Also there are quite a few vouchers by state governments incentivesing people to travel (not to sure how many or how much). 

This also comes with Flight centre recently upgrading and improving their online ability to more efficiently help customers by upgrading to a K2 cloud operating system. 

https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/itbrief.com.au/amp/story/flight-centre-travel-group-updates-cx-and-operations-with-k2-cloud


So my price target in the next 6-12 months is $40, but this would mean People are willing to take the vaccine and corporate and leisure travel actually hit pre COVID level and even all time highs (which is doable but highly speculative)

Then I saw it was at 150$ plus today and was like what is up with this. Based on articles with 1 million subscribers and huge growth and all this doesn’t make any sense and I swear this company is going to drop hard. 

Quick Math: They reached one million subscribers this year. They will have a projected revenue of $93 million for 2020 when next quarter results come out.

They are making on average $93 per customer as an insurance company per year based on “1 million” subs. That is $7.75 per month for customer. That is cheaper than streaming services and they have to pay out claims. 

Compare this to Netflix: 
1 Million Subs for Lemonade: Market Cap-8.5 Billion
200 Millions Subs for Netflix - Market Cap-225 Billion

Based off subscribers/market cap ratio if Lemonade got 200 million they would be worth 1.7 trillion. Also, based on there current revenue per customer they would be hauling in 1.5 billion as a 1.7 trillion company.

So in other words, this company can’t and won’t succeed and their has to be some misleading of investors with the financials. I don’t get how they have a million subs and only 93 million and revenue. There is no chance they can make a profit by doing this and by the way they haven’t.

1. Papa shits on mango due to this weeks events.

2. I actually know what Palantir does now. Daddy Karp had to dumb it down for us autist.

3. Daddy Karp killed Bin Laden and saves your life when you aren't paying attention, so you can continue being a fucking loser in peace.

4. Papa explains how Palantir is helping during covid.

5. Shits on mango again and says the people need to be able to have confidence in our leaders in order to effectively distibute the vaccine and develop herd immunity.

6. Shits on silicone valley. Shits on trumpers for being fucking idiots.

7. Says that Palantir is gladly willing to help the government in ways that big tech wont.

8. Compares the U.S's ability to use Palantir to having acess to nuclear bombs while the rest of the world has machine guns (for national security and defence type stuff).

9. Karp: U.S &gt; the rest of the world.

10. Tells ""big tech"" to stop being pussies and help the U.S continue to dominate in the world.

1610082718,167,0,FALSE,1610082729,1,"Tl;dr If Apple partners with Hyundai, it will most likely be based on the Canoo base platform. This is purely speculation, but grounded in real facts based on looking at the primary area of collaboration for Hyundai's EV partners, Canoo's founders' history with Apple and Canoo's investor presentation.

Let's dive into the FACTS:
Hyundai is in early talks to develop self-driving electric vehicles with Apple [Link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/hyundai-motor-says-it-is-in-early-talks-with-apple.html). Hyundai also has a couple partnerships to co-develop EVs with Rimac, Arrival and Canoo

First take note that in Apple's initial press release, they announced they would be focused on a ""personal, mass-market vehicle rather than a robotaxi or commercial vehicle"" [Link](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35036439/apple-car-2024/)

For this reason, Canoo is the most likely partner. I'll illustrate using a quote from a press release where it mentions the focus of the Canoo partnership is on small, cost-competitive EVs + PBVs (in other words, mass market vehicles), which is the market Apple is focused on. [Link](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia)
""Canoo and Hyundai Motor Group, Hyundai and Kia’s parent company, will develop a new electric vehicle platform that’s based on the one that powers Canoo’s own vehicle, which was unveiled last year. This EV platform will power small, “cost-competitive” electric vehicles, as well as “purpose built vehicles,” which would more closely resemble shuttles or even autonomous people-movers.""

The reason it is much less likely to be with Arrival or Rimac is based on reading their partnership announcements with Hyundai as well.

From Arrival article [Link](https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/company/newsroom/hyundai-and-kia-make-strategic-investment-in-arrival-to-co-develop-electric-commercial-vehicles-0000016387) : ""€100 million investment enables co-development of eco-friendly vans and other products for logistics, on-demand ride-hailing, and shuttle service companies."" 
The target area of the Arrival partnership is on commercial vehicles (delivery vans, shuttles) as opposed to consumer vehicles that Apple will likely target.

From Rimac article [Link]( https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2772): ""Hyundai Motor Group and Rimac Automobili (Rimac) have announced a strategic partnership aimed to strengthen the Group’s efforts to lead the high-performance electrified vehicle market and enhance its status as a game changer in Clean Mobility.""
The target area of the Rimac partnership is high performance, sports concept vehicles also unlikely to be Apple's target market. 

Another piece of potential evidence is from Canoo's investor presentation [Link](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_270955872.png). The picture mentions a project in progress with a Tech Strategic who is ""a player in smart car and autonomous vehicle that has identified Canoo as a base platform to integrate systems.""

There is also plenty of history behind Apple and the Canoo founders to explain why this speculation is actually fairly reasonable thinking. In 2015, Apple was very close to using the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car [Link](https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-innovation/apple-bmw-i3-electric-car-173344/amp). This deal fell apart, but it shows that Apple was impressed by the BMW i team's EV platform. Fast forward 2 years and Canoo is the creation of those same former BMW i-Execs including Ulrich Kranz (former Head of BMW i) and Richard Kim (former Principal Exterior Designer of i3 production vehicle and i3 and i8 concepts at BMW).",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksvs7p/serious_dd_canoogoev_and_the_potential/,,1/8/2021,5:11:58,12:11:58 AM,0:11:58

Immediately as I walk into the store I count 8 people(not counting myself) and 6 in line. This picture was taken a few minutes later with 5 people in line. Last time I went to one of these was about a year ago, and at this time it was only me and my brother in the store, so this is a big change. A whopping 8 people in the store at the time I went in was a considerable amount of people, not even considering that I don't live in a very populated area (some city in Ohio that you've never heard of). This GameStop is part of a strip mall with a Walmart, and there is a Best Buy, and Target within \~2 minute drive. This means that people are still choosing GameStop over other alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 032ton7g71a61...*

What you see above is 1 of 3 out of stock signs. First of all, 3 out of stock signs means that they are selling their stock more than they expected to. Second, this one says that they are out of ps4 controllers, meaning that the new console cycle may be increasing sales in older consoles and older games as well.

Tbh I didn't know that my GameStop had a pc section, and when I heard about GameStops having pc parts I just assumed like keyboards, mice, and maybe like 1 or 2 parts. There are a few decent mice and keyboards to choose from(left of picture), but the part selection is terrible. There are only 1 or 2 options for each part for your pc. Their best and only video card is a GTX 1660 super (this is pretty bad if you don't know). Nobody is going to get their pc parts here. They still have a lot of room to grow in the pc section, they could add a lot more options, maybe even get some overpriced prebuilts, and if their employees knew what they were doing people would probably choose GameStop over Micro Center, (if you don't order your parts, you go to micro center) almost everyone lives closer to a GameStop.

Right now, I'm wanting to release a beta version of my application and I need a few people to help me test it out and get feedback.

The application basically boils down to a slot machine x Robinhood - users can generate random stocks to look at and view price charts and some limited advanced statistics. There's an option to favorite stocks and view a stock's performance since favoriting it, for example.

1610076349,20,0,FALSE,1610076503,2,"  I have a few questions I'd like to consult you SPAC Expert Autists. 

1. If a SPAC common stock price is at $10 and after 2 years, the founders can’t find an acquisition, will shareholders receive $10 back or less?

2. Let’s say if a SPAC raises 250m then it acquires Company X worth 1B, how will the equity interest be calculated for SPAC shareholders? 

3. If you are a retail shareholder of a SPAC, will you be informed in a vote for a potential merger?

4. If a target is announced and the SPAC share price moves from $10 to $20, how will this move affect the SPAC’s equity interest in the merger or the transaction will be determined at $10? 

5. If I buy in a SPAC at $15, and the SPAC transaction fails and shares are redeemed back to their shareholders, the redeemed value may just be $10 or slightly less so I will incur a loss of at least $5 per share. Is it correct?

As the way I understand, it should be a merger, not an acquisition as two companies merge together to become one and assets and liabilities are a combination of both.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksu16b/spac_discussion/,,1/8/2021,3:25:49,10:25:49 PM,22:25:49

1610073424,118,0,FALSE,1610073785,3,"I am amending my post two weeks advocating for $GE leaps in order to take advantage of upcoming electrical grid upgrades. I talked to a ton of people, spent two weeks doing nonstop reading, am **narrowing the play to the Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR**). Please see an amended DD below. **This DD isn't TA.** It is a series of political, market, and energy trend facts/assumptions, within the technical realities of grid management. 

* **WARNING**: this post is long. By necessity, one has to flesh out linear chains of reasoning in long form. I'll give you the one-paragraph **TLDR** at the end. No rockets. 
* **Context:** This is a 10 bagger play but it'll take time, possibly 2-3 years. There aren't any options available for this. Prysmian is guaranteed to print, but slowly, but it is literally guaranteed to print. It think it'll double by EOY at least. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Below is a series of **linear** chain of reasoning with known facts that lead to an outcome that is guaranteed but not priced in. The market isn't carrying the implications of known-trends to their logical conclusion (the material provider--Prysmian) and is currently undervaluing Prysmian Group. Imagine this as a chain of dominos. I will lay each one down consecutively, showing a near-future reality in which a company is set to quintuple if not 10x it's revenue over the next 10 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 25-35% or more of new car sales will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. The average car life is [12 years](https://www.aarp.org/auto/trends-lifestyle/info-2018/how-long-do-cars-last.html#:~:text=A%20typical%20passenger%20car%20should,Lyman%2C%20chief%20analyst%20at%20TrueCar). It is likely that by 2033-2035, a majority of U.S cars are electric. 
2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. [This](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/12/f69/GITT%20ISATT%20EVs%20at%20Scale%20Grid%20Summary%20Report%20FINAL%20Nov2019.pdf) **is a fantastic read--the ""high"" (EV adoption) scenario doesn't show 90% EVs till 2040...which smaller than what is currently happening with new EV models / State/Country bans on ICE vehicles**. The average American home uses \~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3 (75kWh battery), BARELY drive (no commute) and still charge 6-7 times a month (from 20% to 80%), averaging around 13 kWh per day.  A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive, especially when heating the car. **For a non-commuter thats a 30-40% increase, for a daily commuter that's almost a 100% increase.** By 2025, if \~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation planning, permitting, and construction takes a long time. They have to front run this big time because generation facilities (wind/solar) take time to plan, permit, build, and hook-in (HVDC). We're already seeing an absolute renaissance in wind and its only going to keep accelerating along with the EV adoption curve. 
   1. (2B) Additionally, there are other factors behind growing grid demand: California is considering banning gas heating in new homes (Electric heating and anti-gas legislation will increase electric demand for thermal units), an increased interest in hydrogen (via electrosis, for aviation / industry)
   2. (2C) Some people think that added capacity will be curtailed because everyone will charge at night where there is bandwidth for capacity boosts from existing generation facilities. **These people are wrong**. While night-charging will *assuage* total added generation capacity requirements, there isn't enough current night (natural gas) generation capacity to meet the demand of 40-50% EVs, and (see below) its unlikely Natural Gas is gonna keep as fast as it has been, for political reasons. Additionally (1) Not everyone is going to have home charging (apartment buildings, street parking rowhomes) and thus will supercharge at work/while commuting, (2) many people aren't that disciplined to save $3-4 on a charge, (3) people will live their lives normally--charging when they need, often during the day. **A ton of added capacity is needed.** 
3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. As of yesterday, /r/Energy had an [article](https://renewablesnow.com/news/renewables-make-71-of-new-us-power-capacity-in-11-mo-2020-727014/) showing how 71% of the added energy (8000mW wind, 6500mW solar) capacity in 2020 was renewables. This phenomenon has two causes. **(1)** Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind is FAR cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Banks are scared of liberals: Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now (Just this week, Trump opened up those Alaskan areas for bidding and nobody bidded, literally), and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end of oil (and, honestly, nuclear) is near. **(2)** Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion (as noted above). Natural gas isn't that green (big methane problems) and while it's cheap af, its not everywhere (pipeline limits), and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc), which are ALL liberal, are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. Don't believe me? Go read up on California banning natural gas. Yea, Cali can be crazy, but it is almost ALWAYS the harbinger of progressive thinking. Expect that to carry forward. 
4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. Its an amazing kick off to his first year in office. He needs to find a way to boost employment before 2022 in order to have a growth-narrative for the midterms. 2022 midterms don't look good for democrats, and if he doesn't have a strong 2021 year (or at least, optically) he'll get lame ducked in 2023-2024. He's not running in 2024, he's too fucking old. So, how does he go into the twilight of his career with the narrative of a 'Unifier'? He does something everyone can get behind: infrastructure. With the recent Trump supporter capital storming, Biden has some great political bandwidth to hit the ground running. 
5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even with the two blue Georgia seats, there is \*\*ZERO\*\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause he's ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. No-filibuster 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening. Yet, Biden does need to cater to his liberal supporters and fire up the DNC base in 2022. A great way to get people onboard is to blend an infrastructure bill with elements of the Green New Deal. He has to do this. Its the only way to sneak green policies into implementation to cater to the Left. Standalone 'Green New Deal' isn't happening and McConnell isn't going to let something named that pass, but may let green elements be sluffed into a general infrastructure bill. All this aside, infrastructure is *NEEDED.* Everyone and their mother knows this. It's pushing on an open door, at precisely the right time. 
6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes. Yeah, he'll help EV adoption, but that's pretty limited to subsidies (the $7,500 subsidy expansion for Tesla and GM just failed as a line item) and research subsidies. Not good enough for the Left. 
7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at the maps below for for U.S. solar and Wind geographic advantages. What do you notice? For the most part, there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest, Great Lakes, and NE Offshore region. There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor/Great Lakes offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. **If you want to do a Green Energy bill that also serves as a bipartisan stimulus, there are geographic comparative advantages that give you a compelling reason to create green energy in Red states.** 

[Solar Irradiance Map \(2018\)](https://preview.redd.it/uilz3fxoc0a61.jpg?width=5101&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25925051c0038ace93d3cd47392b88a231f1af0c)

&amp;#x200B;

**However, the Grid currently isn't configured to transport the level of green energy needed to meet the heightened demand environment in 2030-2040. Guess what links huge solar fields and onshore/offshore wind to population centers? HVDC does. The HVDC network to pipe ""local"" (regional) renewable hotspots to population centers doesn't exist. See the below map of the U.S. HVDC Grid, and compare it to Europe and China's:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Note all the Offshore Wind to the North Sea, and the connections between Renewable hot spots \(Iceland, etc\) to population centers](https://i.redd.it/hmijqzkxh0a61.gif)

[This won't be surprising. The Chinese do big infrastructure, and half the Party back in the 90s were hydrologic engineers. ](https://preview.redd.it/9ycsi1d5i0a61.jpg?width=1240&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fafd25e782fbd27964d1b1f958e80ea46fc855d6)

In addition to these maps, look at the [**global list of HVDC projects Wikipedia page**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects)**. Observe how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.** It's not our fault, in the past grid owners could easily locate generation facilities near enough to minimize high voltage lines. However, things are changing--wind and solar take space, aren't as location-independent as gas/coal/nuclear. 

&amp;#x200B;

* (8) **Microgrids won't solve the issue.** Obviously Tesla city-level distributed powerpacks will happen, but this isn't an either-or situation. **The speed of EV adoption and the heightened demand environment are going to vastly outpace the adoption of rooftop solar (what many microgrid proponents suggest can fully-deal with grid demand)**. Grid-level wind/solar is still needed, and those sources need to be connected in, so again, a regionalized HVDC connection system from renewable --&gt; population center is still needed. 
* (9) **The more HVDC connections that are installed, the more compelling it will be to form longer-linkages (more HVDC) between population centers (and therefore, storage).** Connected regional grids (think--Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania connected mutually via Great Lakes Wind farms that are, in turn, connected to the NE Corridor) marginally decrease the amount of total net storage needed in the system, as ""the wind is always blowing/sun is always shining somewhere"". This process will continue until we eventually have a 'Supergrid'--but NOT one by original purpose--which is what people usually argue against when people mention that word, but convenience--alongside thousands of microgrids. 
   * If this seems extreme to you, sit back, consider the 2nd point of this post, then imagine 80% of Cars are EVs within 15 years. A vast majority of Semi-trucks are electric. Advances in batteries mean that Planes, shipping, and tons of military applications now all use huge amounts of power. Grid demand is way, WAY higher than it was when the biggest demand source were light bulbs and your shitty AC unit. 
* (10) **The way to play this is by going to the manufacturer / installer**. **Prysmian Group ($PRYMY, an ADR) is the largest HVDC provider in the world. It's also a pure play.** It is based in Milan, but its a union of 3 companies--one of which is General Cable (American), which produces HVDC domestically. See the below image, which is from Prysmian's 2019 annual report. The green dots are energy cable (HVDC) manufacturing facilities. See a trend? They're almost all in Red states (again--renewables largely in Red States, HVDC manufacturing in Red states...)

https://preview.redd.it/m5vyb46so0a61.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=202e61a596fcac6e73c1584e3a5eeec9059dec58

* (11) **45% of Prysmian's revenue is Grid work. It has a P/E of 44. What happens when Prysmian's revenue goes up by 3x over the next 5 years, and 10x by 2030?** There is SO much work to be done modernizing the U.S. grid, but then on to the rest of the world. The realities I am describing--EVs--&gt; heightened demand --&gt; green is cheap --&gt; it needs to be hooked in --&gt; regional grid connections lower net amount of storage needed in aggregate, etc etc etc, aren't unique to the first world. Other countries will follow suit. 

# Conclusion

I do not believe this reality is baked into the price. Although everyone knows grid upgrades are coming (hence 44 P/E), I don't think that people are taking these large-phenomenon down to their lower level logical-conclusions. The gradual, inadvertent development of the Supergrid is inevitable, necessary, and politically convenient for a guy so desperate to bridge the political divide. Prysmian is well suited to take full advantage of American infrastructure as well as the rest of the world. 

\------------------

TL/DR:

**EVs adoption curves are getting faster and faster, and are going to drive higher electrical demands from the Grid, which will be met with Green Energy. This will require a huge increase in HVDC installations. This is occurring at exactly the time Biden needs a big infrastructure plan for political-economic reasons, and the realities of Green energy in the U.S. actually benefit Red States pretty bigly. Gradually, HVDC networks will reach a point where a macro-regional 'Supergrids' become a reality (in order to lower aggregate storage requirements and add more safety/redundancy). $PRYMY (Prysmian Group) is the worlds largest HVDC provider and they manufacture HVDC in the U.S. They are primed to benefit from this trend, and it is currently vastly undervalued.**

1610070091,58,0,FALSE,1610070685,6,"The point Chamath Palihapitiya made about Tesla in the article linked [here](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chamath-palihapitiya-tesla-stock-price-target-elon-musk-net-worth-2021-1-1029941932) is that Tesla is ultimately going to be (or have a large focus on) energy storage and production.

You can already see an example of this with the South Australian (South Australia is a state in...the middle south of Australia) battery storage facility that was a great test run for his proposal and also mimics the plot of one of the evil guys in a Michael Keaton Batman movie oddly enough.

&gt;Palihapitiya said that Tesla was a ""distributed energy business"" and that Musk was figuring out a way to harness energy, store it, and use it to help people to be productive and fight climate change.

The point about this is that decentralised energy generation and power storage offers a lot of benefits (noticeably reduced transmission loss) and if Elon is aiming big, and he is, he may well be angling towards a ""Tesla Battery in every home"" style scenario which while that will open up to competition, even a fractional market share of the *entire first world housing market* would be profitable beyond belief, and especially when you consider the main thing Elon is really, really, really, really, really, good at.

Getting government money.

Due to many governments being left leaning and environmental they'll slavish lap at his space boots to be the first to give him billions to do his ~~space bullshit~~ *genius clean energy programs* and ~~if~~ *when* those programs begin to roll out for clean energy generation and storage then the resulting *revenue* is going to exceed that of Wallmart eventually, and that doesn't include the vast and staggering increase in assets held.

And one the main key points is that Elon will once again spin this out of virtually nothing, getting the staggering fuckhuge government contracts and funding with very lucrative and generous clauses right up front.

So he doesn't have to worry about waiting for a profit, the ventures will be paid for up front and *then* generate profits.

Because of the environmental regulations and tax breaks, a decent analysis and extrapolation of this alone is going to lead to revenues in excess of $500bn within fifteen years, and Elon Musk won't just be a paper trillionaire, he'll be a cold hard cash trillionaire.

This is not money spun out of nothing mind you, this is him gaining control of the energy market and emerging energy storage market which may well causes some friction, but Elon will win that battle as he will have full government support.

tl;dr: Stonks always go up, but TSLA is ***FUCKING STONK*** and will go beyond moon to mars.

Today the insiders who wanted to sell have sold.  Institutions have increased their positions.  And there’s still a ton of short sellers that have to cover.  

A few days ago Fubo released preliminary results https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/fubotv-preliminary-q4-results-indicate-it-will-top/

They are posting huge growth well past their previous estimates.  Marketcap today is under $2B.  This is a netflix/roku type of play at the beginning.  Market is paying a premium for growth (see all EV stocks, weed stocks, etc).  Fubo has the growth and with their niche of live sports they could become involved in a bidding war if some of the major players want to add a new niche to their programming ( I’m looking at you nflx and AMZN ).  But that’s neither here nor there because I think the stock found its floor, the oversupply caused by lockup expiration and high short sales volume has dried up, and between institutions buying in and retail wanting to get in on the next netflix type of play I see this climbing back to $50 very soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been lurking and decided to join in on the fun. Putting in 200€ into Degiro (I'm on EU) and wanna know what are some good easy strats to make some decent money on the side. Of course, I'm having realistic expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I still haven't figured most trading terms so, when buying stock, how do returns work? Can you give me a very ELI5 quick explanation on options vs buying and selling stocks, day orders vs continuous, what are ETFs? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, since i'm on EU, are INRG, GME, PLUG and Wish good investments right now? 

One thing I'm not sure I can do is trade options on my account, since it's a Degiro BASIC and I don't think it covers it.

&amp;#x200B;

Any other pointers I'd love to receive! Thank you",0.2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksrvfy/wanna_get_into_investing_starting_with_200_some/,,1/8/2021,1:23:08,8:23:08 PM,20:23:08

*Sold a $10 wide credit spread on TSLA today for a $90 credit today ($990/$980 calls). This trade loses money if TSLA is over $976 by the Feb expiration cycle. TSLA would have a $919 billion market cap at this stock price.
I know, I know, never bet against TSLA. In this case I think it's had an incredible run lately and adding another 33% to the stock price is very unlikely in the next 46 days.*

1610064740,204,0,FALSE,1610065633,17,"I finally had a chance to read the transcript from today’s earnings call from Schnitzer. 

Here are the key takeaways:

“global raw material prices rose to multiyear highs by the end of the quarter driven by strong recovery in automotive demand, supply chain restocking, a resilient construction market and scrap supply constraints related to COVID-19 restrictions.

More specifically, ferrous export price increases off the East Coast were positively impacted by stronger export demand for Turkish steel products. Through October, Turkey's crude steel production had increased 4.2% year-over-year as steel production returned to pre-pandemic levels to meet higher domestic and export demand while ferrous scrap imports into Turkey were up 19%. Ferrous export price increases off the West Coast were driven by strong semi-finished steel import demand from China and higher steel production in Asia.

A key global driver for the increase in West Coast ferrous export prices has been China's increasing steel demand and China's new ferrous scrap import standards, which have reclassified ferrous scrap as a recycled raw material. We expect this to create higher demand for global ferrous scrap.”

“U.S. domestic prices were underpinned by similar trends. The latest U.S. economic data reflect durable goods orders, industrial production and housing starts rising in November. Ferrous prices have now reached their highest price points in a decade. December's global auto sales doubled from their April lows and were in line with pre-pandemic levels. Current auto inventories are at 10-year lows. Container shipping is experiencing its strongest demand in at least a decade and some steel order books stretch into March and even April.”

HIGHEST PRICE POINTS IN A DECADE - closing in on 2008 levels - THIS IS HUGE - also lining up going back to my original post to kick off this entire steel series of posts. 

Current auto inventories - 10 YEAR LOW

What does that tell you?

Tells me that steel and more importantly steel stocks are going to 🚀 further and further until there is relief. 

As of now, I don’t see that coming until Fall at the earliest. 

More from the call:

“The recent sharp increases in ferrous and nonferrous prices have been driven by low inventory levels after many quarters of destocking, followed by significantly higher steel mill and smelter buy plans and production levels. There are also many LONG TERM trends that support strong and sustainable ferrous and nonferrous scrap demand including the transition to lower carbon technologies, China's elimination of quotas for nonferrous scrap imports that meet its metal content standards and the prospect of China's reemergence as an importer in the global ferrous scrap market. In a world that is seeking decarbonization, we expect recycled scrap metal to be an increasingly important metals carbon solution and for demand to accelerate.”

CHINA. CHINA. CHINA. 

Their need for steel is unquenchable at this point. 

Then you have the rest of the world - THAT ALSO NEEDS STEEL AND RAW MATERIALS. 

Back to the call:

“Global demand for recycled ferrous increased in the first quarter which was driven by continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus and concerns over tight supply. Our flexible operating platform, our logistics expertise and our global sales reach, all helped us to maximize the benefits from this heightened demand. We shipped 63% of our ferrous in the quarter to the export market and we sold the remainder into the domestic market. Our top total country destinations for ferrous exports were Bangladesh, Turkey and Vietnam.”

Wait until China purchases start. 

I expect deals to be done soon and a new benchmark will be set. 

Back to earnings from the call:

“Our adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $40 million. This performance was up significantly from $28 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and was quadruple the adjusted EBITDA in the prior year quarter. The combination of improved market conditions and benefits from management initiatives led to an expansion of our operating margins.

Adjusted EBITDA per ferrous ton reached $38 taking us to pre-pandemic levels last achieved in fiscal 2019. This also represented a sequential improvement of $11 per ferrous ton. Around half of that increase came from improved markets and the other half from actions we have taken. These included our commercial initiatives and productivity improvements which were enabled by our new One Schnitzer organization model and a benefit of $2 per ferrous ton from a sales contract settlement. Benefits in the quarter from average inventory accounting were approximately $2 per ton. This compared to a similar impact in the previous quarter and an adverse impact of $4 per ton in the first quarter of the prior year.”

Bottom-line Schnitzer blew past all expectations, as I had predicted. 

Paper hands sold the news. 

However, the AH market popped up again. 

This is a $50 stock in short order and has legs to reach $60. 

I think it reaches back into the low $40’s next week and possibly hits blue sky $43+ mid next week. 

The MOST IMPORTANT thing to take away from this call is that steel is reaching levels we have not seen in over a decade based on scrap and raw material costs.  

This will translate to higher steel prices = higher revenues = higher margins = higher EPS. 

2021 WILL BE A STEEL SUPER-CYCLE. 

TL,DR

I like this to hit $50 soon. 

I took a gamble and bought $40 calls expiring next week when it bottomed out late today from its highs. 

I’m betting on a bounce and then blue sky. 

Good luck and do your own research.",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksql7s/schnitzer_earnings_call_review_steel_outlook/,,1/8/2021,0:12:20,7:12:20 PM,19:12:20

1. India is one of the fastest growing economies in Asia

2. 2022 calls cheap as FUCK

3. Steady historical graph, steady upwards trend with minimal volatility

4. Not overvalued, value stocks tend to not drop 5% cuz they cant get any cheaper.

5. Best to stay away from US stocks with ATH indexes.

This is a fucking home run opportunity right here.

So I finally convinced my wife’s bf to lend me the couple hundred dollars he had in the glove compartment of his Tesla. 
I bought 16.5C jan29-21 a month ago the day before it went 25% up, and so I quickly made 150% easy shit 🚀🚀🚀. The it went down, traded sideways and I eventually closed it for 25% profit instead. And as such I learned shout time decay....

When I’m getting at, is that I’m drowning in jizz from today’s 1000% gain porn, and I seriously need some of your autism in me.

What’s your fucking strategy? ITM or OTM?
And how deep would you go? How long till expiration? or do you just go find a good price and figure it out from there?

So about a month or so ago I bought 25 132$ call expiring 1/8/21 on $TIF. They were super cheap at the time (125$ total) and I honestly didn't really understand what I was doing. They were planning on releasing their earnings report late December/ early January. I thought that with the holidays and the general uncertainty of the world. People might be buying jewelry, but the real reason I bought it was because it was cheap and i'm dumb.

Well, now January 8th is tomorrow and the current stock is not showing up on Finviz, yahoo finance or Robinhood. I can see on Google Finance that the AH for TIF is 132.40 which would net me a decent profit, but I can't find the stock through my broker (Robinhood, yea RH. boo... w/e).

I've been looking through the news and discovered that TIF was bought out by LVMH recently for 16 billion, but I'm not sure where that leaves me. Will my options even show up tomorrow? or will it expire worthless. Is the recent buyout the reason why I can't see the shares anymore? Also why was $TIF not really moving at all for the past 3 months.

Super newbie here, any help is appreciated",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksp8ed/questions_about_tif_calls_expiring_tomorrow/,,1/7/2021,23:03:22,6:03:22 PM,18:03:22

1610057023,63,0,FALSE,1610058185,5,"Hi fellow retards, 

Pfizer is reporting earnings on 2/2 and I expect them to beat estimates due to the large orders they're receiving for the vaccine. 

Also I think their upcoming rebrand will move the needle as well.

I know you guys think pharma is tapped but the market is assuming it will be gone this year, news to the contrary may be coming out soon as they study the new variant. This could turn to a seasonal flu like situation, I don't think Covid is going anywhere.

Inseego has landed contracts with T-Mobile in December as it's first 5G contracts and has now established a 5G contract with Japan, Grape one. It's had a 50% growth and has been making me bank since December, it has plenty of room to grow.

5G has just started to become a reality, all large American carriers are moving to use it as the norm, and every new flagship phone supports 5G standard, 2021 is when the average consumer will start using and wanting 5G, with the high amount of data consumption and streaming with unlimited plans the craving for faster speeds has never been higher.

I'm buying leaps and June contracts, this thing is going to moon like crazy this Summer.

NYT article from 2018, some interesting content:

“If Mr. Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion — a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make Tesla one of the five largest companies in the United States, based on current valuations — his stock award could be worth as much as $55 billion”

“Mr. Musk’s critics — and there are many — are likely to contend that the new compensation plan is just the company’s latest publicity stunt.”

Elon contended, “I actually see the potential for Tesla to become a trillion-dollar company within a 10-year period.”

There you go, TSLA to be a trillion dollar company, probably even faster than Papa Elon predicted.

God emperor Elon has done in 2 years what no-one else has done in history. Now the richest person in the world, any 🌈 🐻 that tells you that TSLA is overpriced isn’t autistic enough to believe in a man 10x more autistic and genius than them.

I personally have been selling 17.50 and 20.00. I also bought some shares because sofi is an exciting company.

What you’re about to read is probably very retarded. Furthermore, I am a steel bitch. Furthermore, I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advise. 
To summarize, fuck bears.

Now, to the point:

CMC, or Commercial Metals Company, reports their earnings on January 11th. Curiously, however, if you go to the “Investor” page of their website, you can scroll down and easily see “4Q 2020 something or other.” Having read this, and keeping the very first slide (“this is forward guidance, don’t sue us, etc.”) in mind, it seems reasonable to me to assume that this is their prediction/guidance for their 4Q results. That being said, I have done a very retarded calculation: their predicted quarter adjusted earnings for “4Q 2020” are about 175 million, with 115 or so million shares outstanding. Without getting too autistic, it seems very reasonable to conclude that even if I have not properly taken some shit into account, their guidance suggests earnings above $1 per share.
And yet!
Here’s the kicker.
Robinhood estimates their earnings at $0.52 or so per share.
TDA from 0.49 to 0.61.
How can it be that these analysts have predicted earnings so clearly off the company’s expectation, furthermore during a commodity (especially steel) bull cycle??

If anyone with more brain cells than I wishes to take a look, please do. If you don’t, please do all the same.
Am I retarded?

SoFi. IS HUGE. Chamath is behind this baby. They IMO are way better than RH that most autists here are using. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-IRA

\-investing education

\-benefits for being a member

\-active and non active investing from sofi (robo)

\-they have ACUTAL CUSTOMER SERVICE

\-their website is the tits! its not like the same RH crap we see that is a bunch ofbull.  


\-of course no comish, etc...same standard things like on RH.

TLDR:

&amp;#x200B;

IPOE ( i realize merger was only announced)  will beat RH if ever it was going to go public. they done messed up RH.

1610048685,9,0,FALSE,1610049437,4," • For **AAPL** (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://www.futunn.com/quote/stock?m=us&amp;code=AAPL)), we notice a **call** option **sweep** that happens to be **bearish**, expiring in 1 day(s) on **January 8, 2021**. A trader bought **299** contract(s) at a **$130.00** strike. This particular call needed to be split into 5 different trades to become filled. The trader or institution spent **$35.5K** on this trade with a price of **$119.0** per contract. There were **41140** open contracts at this strike prior to today, and today **89557** contract(s) were bought and sold. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why would this be bearish? Is it because the trader bought the $130 call when stock is $130+ (or this morning below $130)?

new to options, would like to learn more.

I'm holding a few $128/$129$130 01/08 call.

1610047899,47,0,FALSE,1610048588,12,"&gt;The **U.S. economy may soon experience higher inflation** than has been seen for quite some time, said St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard on Thursday.

&gt;In a conversation with reporters following a talk with a business group in Little Rock, Arkansas, Bullard also said he thinks the economy is going to recover “quite a bit faster” than most economists expect.

&gt;On inflation, Bullard said his bank has gotten reports of supply constraints of various kinds that are intense and led to big increase in prices.

&gt;“The quiescence of **inflation that has characterized the last decade may not be a good guide for what’s going to happen in 2021**, where I would expect more volatile pricing, possibly **higher inflation than we’re used to**,” Bullard said.

The Feds 🤡 are telling us to strap in on your seats because we are going past Titan for Pluto now. Volatile Pricing, Higher Inflation since 2008, supply constraints = 🚀🚀🚀 

After Pluto, the Feds will take us to crash into the Andromeda galaxy first before they crash into us.

NIU makes affordable electric scooters. Yet another EV manufacturer I hear you ask.. except this ones cool, it's two wheels, it's sustainable, it's beautiful - the perfect city commuter transport!

Let's get down to the facts and figures:

$2.04 bil mcap

$2.08 bil revenue (2019)

$486 mil profit (2019)

84 PE

$791 mil Net equity


This gives it a price to book ratio of about 2.57 compared to Tesla's 108, you're really getting second to none VALUE!

Revenue EQUAL to its market cap!!! By comparison, Tesla revenue is a mere 5% of its market cap.

So, air filtration/hvac/home improvement commercial/residential play on Comfort Systems ($FIX).

They just crested their ATH and stock is now in the ether and floating at around $58. Now look at the chart.

1/15/21 60c looking good to anyone else? 

Not a lot of options traded on this one, but 1/15/21 is turning into a weekly of sorts—setup for next week.

True price is currently like $0.40-$0.60 for the call (not enough bid/ask action to see real price).

Anyway, $0.50 risk for $3.00+ upside on calls if underlying could hit $63 by next Friday.

Trane (TT) had performed strongly, but FIX is comparatively unknown (TT been printing for me since summer).

It’s a fairly simple play—but infrastructure spending is good here for FIX as they’ve a lot of commercial exposure, and we get to play the air filtration/hvac angle along with infrastructure spending.

Downsides? Not enough volume on this yolo to get out: if it goes the wrong way, it’s over.

But I dig the play for a 300%+ return. IMHO, you run this play one hundred times and it returns markedly more than it loses.

ABB is a swiss/swedish robotics and automation company that works on EV charging stations and green energy solutions.  ABB is a technology leader that is driving the digital transformation of industries. With a history of innovation spanning more than 130 years, ABB has four customer-focused, globally leading businesses: Electrification, Industrial Automation, Motion, and Robotics &amp; Discrete Automation, supported by the ABB Ability™ digital platform. ABB operates in more than 100 countries with about 147,000 employees.

&amp;#x200B;

**They've been in the EV game since 2010 and just opened a new $30 million facility for creating chargers.**

&gt;As a global market leader in e-mobility solutions, the $30 million investment in this new facility is further evidence of ABB’s continued commitment to driving innovation in this fast-growing sector. It follows a $10 million investment in a new fully sustainable, global e-mobility headquarters and Research and Development (R&amp;D) center built on the TU Delft Campus, Heertjeslaan, Netherlands which is set to officially launch later this year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The new plant will produce ABB's entire portfolio of direct current (DC) electric vehicle battery chargers, from domestic systems to systems for installation in public areas and those dedicated to urban public transport. It will also help to further support ABB’s growth and innovation in the e-mobility sector.

**Along with a $10 million facility for R&amp;D**

&gt;Designed to spur further innovations in e-mobility, the $10 million, 3,600 sq m facility is based on the Delft University of Technology campus, in the Netherlands and will drive ABB’s future portfolio development, as well as R&amp;D projects for EVs. The University was ranked among the top 15 engineering and technology universities in the world in the QS World University Rankings in 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;As part of this investment, we are focused on pushing the boundaries of e-mobility, predominantly in the areas of charging, storage and digitalization. The new lab will allow us to strengthen our collaboration with EV manufacturers to drive further performance and progress across the sector.”

**They also spend $400 Million on R&amp;D each year.**

&gt;Muehlon says: “Within ABB Electrification, we invest approximately $400 million per annum into R&amp;D to ensure we remain at the forefront of technological leadership and set the standard when it comes to sustainable mobility.

&gt;ABB has been selected to supply its Terra HP charging stations as part of the biggest electric vehicle infrastructure project to date in the United States.  
&gt;  
&gt;The chargers, which can refresh even the largest electric vehicle battery in under  15 minutes, were selected for deployment  by Electrify America, which plans to place hundreds of charging stations within and around 17 metropolitan areas and along multiple nationwide highway corridors.  
&gt;  
&gt;Creating a national network of fast charging stations – the EV equivalent of fueling stations – is considered crucial for widespread adoption of electric cars in the United States.

MGNI is an advertising company on pace to have **a great year** and its stock has grown accordingly. However some 🌈🐻 over at Spruce Point Capital like to ruin the fun.

**Spruce Point are FRAUDS**

Lets look at some other sell ratings from Spruce Point:

AVY - On 10/10/20, Spruce Point gave them a sell rating with a price target of $68-99. At the time, AVY's price was 151.64. At the time of this post, it is trading at 162.19

This vaccine is a total game changer, especially with the logistics and administration problems we’re seeing across the US. The single dose is a cheaper cost per vaccinated person, and eliminates the requirement for hospitals to track patients for vaccine types and 2nd visits. 

The vaccine is also storable at standard refrigerated temperatures. This will make it easier to transport, handling, and a viable options for for countries / communities without ultra low temp freezers.J&amp;J’s vaccine will no doubt be preferred over 2-dose, ultra cold stored alternatives.

1610040984,21,0,FALSE,1610041194,2,"Was reading a day old post about NGA that talked about some pretty bland stuff and realized nobody understands the company as I do. 

One thing, and the largest thing the OP failed to mention, and the reason I bought into this stock with a good % of my portfolio, is that Amazon purchased a good bit of LION and reserved a % 
 of lions capacity for its bus order to AMZN through the next couple years.

You might think ok well it’s just Amazon seeing if they can poach another good company in its infancy but not really. This is a strategic cost savings plan for them that allows them to purchase a company and expense that money later. Think integration. 

Why? Look into Amazon’s bus contracts in major cities. Almost nobody knows that Amazon spends ~8 figures a year in many of the cities it operates in to bus its employees to and from its FCs at no cost to the employees. Sometimes they do it because it’s agreed to for tax exemptions, other times because they’re nice (and rich) like that. By purchasing EVs they’ll get sooo many more benefits though. With equity in the company they’re buying from a % of profit flows back to them.  Emissions credits to offset their FC costs, and they can expense all the bus purchases and operating coats to offset FC income, effectively enabling them to offset the purchase of the equity in LION through FC expense. Not to mention the major capital injection to an early moving EV company, once cities see these Lion busses everywhere they’ll be like hey, great idea, and now because Lion is already producing at scale to support the AMZN order, their busses are competitively priced and they can break even or make money on the product while other companies are operating at a loss. 

It’s a brilliant deal for them when you consider everything. And it enables LION to scale up risk free.

TLDR: buy NGA for zero risk tendies.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksi744/all_aboard_the_lion_bus_why_nga_is_in_a_distant/,,1/7/2021,17:36:24,12:36:24 PM,12:36:24

Why is this important and what does it have to do with the steel gang? Take a look at the ranking of steel production by region below:

1. China excluding Hebei Province
2. Hebei province China excluding Tangshan City
3. Tangshan City, Hebei China excluding production under reported in Tangshan City

4-8  Japan, USA, India, Russia, Korea

9. Production amount under-reported in Tangshan City

10. Germany

Why would they under report production in Tangshan City, you may ask? Because China is trying to reduce its steel output as the industry itself creates a shit ton of pollution. As part of China's made in China 2025 strategy they are trying to move all these low end manufacturing to places like India and Vietnam so they can upgrade their industries.

Chuck wants to buy a 50% share in Sneeds Banana Stand. Chuck asks himself, what is a reasonable price to pay for half of this banana stand?

* Price to profit ratio (P/E ratio): 2.73

Chuck is willing to take on a little more risk than this. Hell, this Banana Stand really shows a lot of promise! And Sneed, well, Sneed is like a genius! He had a great Banana Stand over on the other side of town that sold tons of bananas. What if Chuck paid ... $25,000 ?

* Total Banana Stand earnings for last fiscal year: $365
* P/E ratio: 137
* Time to recoup his $25,000 investment: 137 years.

IPOD - $400m in size

IPOE - $700m in size

IPOF - $1B in size 

&amp;#x200B;

SPAC has very limited downside and huge upside potential. If no deal, all shareholders will be returned $10 after the 2-year deadline. Now, the most painful part about betting on SPAC is that you never know when a deal will be announced... But there are rumors that will bring up the stock price.

&amp;#x200B;

For IPOF, it's almost guaranteed that a deal will be announced very soon. This is what Chamath, the owner of IPOF tweeted before Christmas:

This deal has to be IPOF because IPOE was reported to be merging with SoFi today. Both $DM and $MP's deal sizes were $250m and $350m so it's VERY unlikely to be IPOD.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: BUY IPOF. I'm too retarded to buy options. Although IPOF already 30% up but it's still early. It's not uncommon to see a SPAC double or even triple in price. See LGVW, HYLN, IPOB .. I don't need to list all of them. Basically limited downside and huge upside. But if you get in, be ready to ride the whole journey until the merger completes.. which is usually 3 months out.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kshclr/ipof_chamaths_biggest_spac_deal_ever_deal/,,1/7/2021,16:56:58,11:56:58 AM,11:56:58

I think I found another trade that I put on my post history to be proud. GM's EV telecast is live on Tuesday next week starting at 9 am.

[GM Exhibit Zero](https://www.gmexhibitzero.com/?ppc=MICROSOFT_700000001963580_71700000075931055_58700006613608784_p59796139135&amp;gclid=0398ece7322f170eaf94b31008ca084e&amp;gclsrc=3p.ds&amp;&amp;d_src=313715&amp;d_adsrc=4137267&amp;d_campaign=71700000075931055&amp;d_site=MICROSOFT&amp;d_adgroup=58700006613608784&amp;d_keyword=%2Bexhibit+%2Bzero&amp;gclick=) \- It will dramatically introduce the next wave of electric vehicles for GM moving into 2021. The CEO there and it's being pumped pretty intensely by GM. GM's current options are the Bolt and it's selling incredibly well.

"" Sales of the electric Chevrolet Bolt jumped 26.4% to 20,754 for 2020 compared with 2019 and the brand has ""very aggressive goals in 2021 with both the Bolt and the Bolt EUV,"" Majoros said. The 2022 Bolt EUV compact SUV will be on the same second-generation Battery Electric Vehicle architecture as the Bolt.""

You take a look at the option chain, and there is incredible levels of call buying deep down the chain. The 48 call has massive volume. That's over an 11% increase in appreciation in a week. Granted, that's probably retail, but the point stands. It is wildly speculated that they are going to introduce a completely EV Silverado, which is it's most popular car. Best of luck out there. I personally bought an Equinox this Q, so there's that.

1610035758,9,0,FALSE,1610035800,1,"John Deere and other agricultural stocks are on an upward trend and have the potential to see great gains.

This is because:
Agricultural commodity prices have risen very quickly in the past month(s) due to worldwide weather and shortages. Farmers have also gotten a lot of support from government programs in the last few years.

Thus, farmers have more money to spend on equipment from companies like John Deere, CNH Industrial (CNHI), etc.

We are seeing commodity prices that haven't been seen since the highs of 2011-12, and you have to get in soon while they're still on the rise!

1610035492,90,0,FALSE,1610035516,1,"Alright boys - welcome to a new addition to the commodity club. We continue our narrative today with Nickel. $.05c about to make you so hard. 

Quick disclaimer - today's post will focus on $VALE. So much news to share about why this is about to go to $25-27 by March. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Earnings** \- [Link](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aqh0bpkatZYkciY7YA4lH8hq3BQ?e=GA4hvF)

Earnings for Q3 were very solid. If you reference the above link, I've shared details into VALE's Q3 earnings. There's a few key takeaways: 

* Reference the Avg Prices tab and see what VALE got in Q3 for each commodity. For Q4, there's a few big winners we should expect: 
   * Iron Ore - up 30% in Q4. This is VALE's largest commodity and likely priced into earnings. It is 80% of their revenue. 
   * Met Coal - also up 30% in Q4. This is another huge line item for VALE and was a loss in Q4. At current prices, this will be an easy winner, but only 1% of their revenue. 
   * Copper - up about 20% in Q4. This is 5% of their revenue and drive about $500m in profits in Q4. 
   * Nickel - up about 15% in Q4. This is about 10% of their revenue. 
* VALE made $2.9b in Q3. That's about $.59/share. They have a 3.9% dividend to go along with this. 
* Production was up over Q1 and Q2, but depressed since 2019. Some of this has been a result of declining ore quality and Covid. There was also a landslide that caused some production loss. 

**High-Level Research**: 

Okay - so core commodity prices are increasing. We also know that VALE sends about 60% of their product to China. So how does this translate? Here's where I explain why Q4 will be amazing, and how Nickel will be the catalyst for a massive earnings beat. 

* Iron Ore is super expensive, and we are seeing massive shipments being sent to China. China is so short on steel that they are buying scrap for the first time ever from Japan. Here's a series of articles/tweets to read: 
   * [Post 1](https://twitter.com/YuanTalks/status/1346356073309978624?s=19) \- Iron Ore hitting record high prices, but shipments falling
   * [Post 2](https://www.mysteel.net/article/5020695-0501/WEEKLY--Aust--Brazilian-iron-ore-shipment-over-Dec-28-Jan-3.html) \- looking at shipping details, we see that VALE's shipments actually increased while iron from Australia fell. VALE shipped 6.5m tons of iron in the last week of the year - that's about $1b in revs in a week. 
   * [Post 3](https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-shipments-from-brazil-and-australia-set-record-high/) \- even though shipments fell in the last week of December, shipments are at all time highs. VALE is literally sending mountains of iron to China at record prices. Yay! 
      * Also note that the Baltic Dry Index is nearing highs too. Shipping rates are expensive and will hurt margins slightly. 

**Projections**: 

Okay - so Iron is going to be a huge winner in Q4. Right now, here's the earnings projections for VALE: 

* Low - $.5/share (about $2.5b in profit) 
* Medium - $.8/share (about $4b in profit) 
* High - $1/share (about $5b in profit) 

At Q3 output levels and current prices, we should expect to be near the high estimate of $1/share. Revs are expected at $12-13b, but should be much higher given current shipping details we've seen from VALE to China. At the worst, we have a Rev and Earnings beat. 

So why Nickel? 

**Thesis**: 

If you reference the Q3 Earnings Call - Nickel was the clear callout for VALE's earnings beat last quarter. You'll regularly see Nickel prices and sales being a major driver for increased earnings. 

Here's Nickel's [chart](https://tvc-invdn-com.akamaized.net/data/tvc_b0922c4db148b2c166ae2ff909d8183a.png): 

&amp;#x200B;

[Nickel Futures](https://preview.redd.it/y36ns5ublx961.png?width=1677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d09c9901ac2abdb4914ae42fd17f097c4e069d2)

Nickel just broke out and is entering a massive bull market. Currently Nickel is trading at $18,000/ton, which is much higher than VALE's realized price of $15,000/ton in Q3. What's interesting is that Nickel is rising despite [rising stock piles](http://www.kitcometals.com/charts/lmewarehouse.html) in warehouses. 

Here's where we get a bit speculative - reference VALE's Nickel production here: [Link](http://www.vale.com/EN/investors/information-market/quarterly-results/QuarterlyResultsDocs/PREREPORT3T20_i_vf.pdf)

Mining outputs are variable quarter to quarter due to weather, ore grades, demand, prices, etc - sometimes when bull markets or demand increases, miners turn on production that was previously on hold. We see that in Q3, VALE saw soaring demand for Nickel as it relates to sales, and this would be an indicator for a higher demand for Nickel. However, nickel output is actually down from 2019, when prices were at similar prices to today. 

With nickel prices breaking out and appearing to be headed much higher, VALE might have offline nickel production that they'll turn back on to take advantage of higher demand and prices. Additionally, nickel prices are looking like they might go significantly higher into Q4, and have a much higher price target than say iron or coal. We've also seen VALE buy miners in Indonesia for additional Nickel production, which is aligned with this ongoing Nickel breakout. 

**Prediction**: 

VALE's nickel output will return to 2019 levels and take advantage of the current pricing. We could see an additional 20m tons produced, and a massive profit line item on Q4. Additionally, if VALE can lock in these prices for Q4 and continue to increase production and see rising prices, Nickel could become 15-20% of VALE's business and bring in over $1b in profit a quarter. 

Based on an expected earnings/rev beat and future outlook for VALE, I'm expecting the share price to jump to $25-27 in March based on current P/E and other metrics for the stock. 

**Positions**:

Looking into a lot of analytics that I've had success with, I think that $GIS has a great option chance! Analyst and P/E expectations have turned positive which has led to a price increase of around 2% within the coming week. This has happened 5 times in the past which has led to 85% of those days resulted in an upward move in a week period.

\- The median move for the week is 2% and with GIS dropping early this morning is a great chance to buy it. My hit ratio for that comes in very high around 90%. I am in at a strike price of 57.5.

In fact, shorts in the Cleveland-based steel producer goes back decades.  

LTV Steel (once a customer of CLF; now is owned by CLF) had the biggest bankruptcy in history that started in the late 80s, and there were retail shorts who sold more shares short than the firm had outstanding! 

Gordon Johnson/Axiom Capital had some legal issues related to defamation and CLF CEO, LG.  Same folks had a ginormous short position that just weeks ago turned bullish.

Naked short selling is illegal in some countries, and is a money maker for brokerages as they profit from interest they charge investors to borrow shares they don’t own so they can sell them in the hopes of buying them back sooner for a profit.  Totally turns the zero-sum game of the stock market on its side. 

When there are a limited amount of shares available to borrow, brokerages form a list of stocks that appear on a list called “hard to borrow.”  

CLF has been on this list for quite some time, and continues to be. 

From Investopedia:
“A hard-to-borrow list is an inventory record used by brokerages to indicate what stocks are difficult to borrow for short sale transactions. A brokerage firm's hard-to-borrow list provides an up-to-date catalog of stocks that cannot easily be borrowed for use as a short sale.”

https://www.irw-press.com/de/news/nachweis-des-neuen-virenstamms-mit-covid-19-testkit-von-datametrex-ai-moeglich_54923.html?isin=CA23809L1085

Datametrex has various AI products which they have already sold to NATO, US Air Force and Air Canada.
**In addition they have the license on the best covidtests in the world. Their test is also able to detect the new UK mutation of the virus as well as the OG China one.** They are now offering these tests to various airlines and other large companies (Walt Disney etc.).
The capital generated by these tests will be invested in AI products and research. It is not for nothing that DM is also called the ""little Palantir"".

**DM is still completely undervalued with a P/E ratio of 2.**

This year they have delivered an exceedingly insane performance (cash generation), which will certainly not go unnoticed for long.
Looking at Datametrex's business, it can be said that Datmetrex has kicked off numerous exceedingly promising developments in 2020 that will pay off in 2021. 1. In April 2020, CEO Marshall Gunter had announced that the COVID business would be used to move the AI business forward. In September 2020, M. Gunter announced that DM had someone in Berlin to build the business in Germany/Europe. Then in December 2020 DM launched NexaSMART and on Dec 30, 2020 DM announced with a press release that NexaSMART is available in German and they want to focus on the campaign in Germany in 2021. In my opinion this is the right approach and especially the right time, as this will boost the license-business, build a cash flow base, reputation and valuable contacts in Germany. If Datametrex establishes its land-and-expand strategy in the German economy, as it did in South Korea, there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of customers and AI sales (we have 1,400 billion euro turnover companies alone, all of which are on the move on social media and the like). By the way, most investors in Germany are not yet aware that NexaSMART is available in Germany, as the news was only published in English. 2. there is an application, for a $40 million AI funding contract with the Canadian Department of National Defence in the pipeline. The grant application has been submitted in conjunction with MDA, with whom Datametrex is working in the IDEaS program. This means that if DM is successful in getting the application through, which is still doubtful, then the $40 million CAD will be shared with MDA and over several years. If we conservatively assume 30% DM and 70% MDA and a three-year funding contract, that should mean: 40 million CAD * 0.3 / 3 years * 0.64 Euro exchange rate = 2.56 million Euro AI contract in 2021, 2022, 2023 AND further development of AI products. 3. in South Korea, former LOTTE Cybersecurity Vice President Edward Choi has been in charge of Datametrex's AI business since July 2020. Since then, Datametrex Korea has signed new AI contracts with LOTTE, Samsung, SeeS, 7Eleven (Robotic Process Automation as pilot for new AI product), Seoul Airport Company (Batch Management Pilot as new AI product), Insurance Company, ... concluded. In 2021, further contracts are likely to be added and possibly one or the other pilot will be transferred to a follow-up contract. This would then also mean that DM would have new AI products in its portfolio. 4. DM is exchanging views with NATO this summer on the further use of NexaSMART. Follow-up discussions with U.S. Cyber Command are also pending. In addition, in the private sector, NexaSMART is to be rolled out in Canada and the US (basis for Land-And-Expand strategy, which should then lead to the million-dollar contracts in 2022 and 2023 (as in South Korea). 5. COVID business will continue to gain momentum in 2021. On the one hand, people willing to travel will not miss the opportunity to fly on vacation again this year, and on the other hand, this will require either vaccination or a negative test result. As an Air Canada accredited provider of Corona testing, Datametrex will earn from the holiday-related testing demand. In addition, Hollywood has halted the vast majority of productions in California. However, with demand for film and series productions higher than ever and Vancouver being the second largest production location for TV and movies, more productions will be moved to Canada.

\*I have to actually spell out the company name because this dumb subreddit thinks its still a spac (its not and hasn’t been since 2018). The ticker is just the first letter of each word

Hopefully you listened to me last time:  
 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaskh2/infrastructure\_and\_energy\_alternative\_is\_the\_next/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaskh2/infrastructure_and_energy_alternative_is_the_next/)

You probably didn’t and chased some shitty call option that failed.

At the time of that post Infrastructure and Energy Alternative commons were at $11.30 and warrants at $1.50. Commons now are tickling $20 (almost double) and warrants around 4 (2.5x gain). Not bad.

You’re probably wondering why I would still recommend Infrastructure and Energy Alternative after the nice run it has had recently. Well, with 2bn in revenue and now with the dems taking Georgia, we are going to see TRILLIONS of dollars pour into green energy this year and onwards. The best part is Infrastructure and Energy Alternative still sits at a paltry 420mm market cap (less than 0.25x revenue). 

Yesterday you saw all 3 othet green energy stocks: Cleanspark, FCEL and PLUG run 30% even though all 3 are already madly overvalued. Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is the best deal of the 3 and still has a ton of room to run. It is clear that green energy is going to boom this year.

Motley fool had an interesting mention of Infrastructure and Energy Alternative today too:  
 [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/why-blink-charging-vulcan-materials-and-infrastruc/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/why-blink-charging-vulcan-materials-and-infrastruc/)

I know you won’t click the link to read it but here is the important part  
 

*Indeed, Infrastructure &amp; Energy Alternatives just might turn out to be the most promising of these three stock opportunities. Although the company reported only $13.2 million in net profit over the past 12 months according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), that number is more than twice what Infrastructure and Energy Alternative earned last year. Moreover, free cash flow generation at Infrastructure and Energy Alternative was a very robust $68.6 million over the past year. At a market capitalization of just $410 million, that works out to an ultra-cheap price-to-free cash flow ratio of less than six.*

*Almost entirely uncovered on Wall Street, Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives could be the small-cap stock to watch in 2021.*

Best part, like they just mentioned, is Infrastructure and Energy Alternative is STILL NOT DISCOVERED BY WALL STREET. This is still ground floor. Potential ENPH type move in 2021 for Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. 🚀

If you look at the Infrastructure and Energy Alternative chart, there is a very obvious pattern that has been happening since summer. It moons roughly 80-100% then dips 30% and consolidates… rinse and repeat. It looks like it just finished its recent consolidation in the 16-17 area and is ready for its next leg up to $30.

Funds have been adding mad in the most recent consolidation period between $15-$17. The volume is regularly over 1million now when just a month ago it was a struggle to hit 500-700k. It is clear that funds are starting to find Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. It was also recently added to a few ETF’s and index’s. 

IMO Infrastructure and Energy Alternative will see $30 relatively soon. $30 on the commons gives us $10 warrants. When you hit the $10 warrants (or whatever price youre happy with) you can then flip then into the commons and let them ride throughout 2021.

You can obviously buy calls but I think warrants are the better deal here for the potential 100% move + in the short and midterm.

P.s. read through my previous wsb post (link at the top) if youre interested in the deeper numbers regarding Infrastructure and Energy Alternative. This is ENPH for 2021 baby.

Cheers boys",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kseo3o/infrastructure_and_energy_alternative_is_the_enph/,,1/7/2021,14:47:25,9:47:25 AM,9:47:25
1610030833,26,0,FALSE,1610030878,1,"Greetings to all who read this,

today I am sharing some due-diligence I recently did on $QS. QS has been a hot stock in recent months having made large moves, both up and down. They also entered the market as a SPAC and as they are intensely research-based, have no prior financials worth noting. So this dd post focuses on their innovation and their management and recent news. I hope you all enjoy it and look forward to any discussion!

&amp;#x200B;

**QUANTUMSCAPES DUE DILIGENCE (5th Jan)**

Intro to QS: "" QuantumScape Corp. engages in the provision of energy storage solutions. It focuses on the development of solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles. The company was founded by Jagdeep Singh, Tim Holme, and Fritz B. Prinz in May 2010 and is headquartered in San Jose, CA. ""

&amp;#x200B;

*First I checked their ratings and trend summary on* [*stockinvest.us*](https://stockinvest.us)*. Here is what I found:*

· Rated as sell on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) (changed to buy on the 6th Jan)

· Trending search for the day/week though (bullish - investor sentiment shows hype and interest)

* “QS Stock Risk:

This stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be ""very high risk"". During the last day, the stock moved **$13.60** between high and low, or **28.69%**. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of **17.36%**.

Our recommended stop-loss: **We hold a sell evaluation for this stock. No stop-loss set.""**

· Volume has increased on the 4th (of January) by 69 million shares but on falling prices.

· Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise **185.84%** during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between **$142.81** and **$406.18** at the end of this 3-month period.

&amp;#x200B;

*Next I checked Motley Fool (although I have no confidence in their analysis overall), to see what they had to say:*

· QuantumScape is several years from commercial production, and its current [market capitalization](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-is-market-cap/) is still over $18 billion. Investors who want to speculate on the potential of QuantumScape and its business need to plan on a lot of volatility in the years leading up to its technology going to market.

· Investors have jumped in, excited about the potential, but QuantumScape will soon have a lot more shares trading. The company updated an S-1 filing at end of December registering more than 300 million shares, with at least 60 million not subject to any lockup agreement and able to be sold as soon as the filing gets the rubber stamp from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

· More shares available typically means downward pressure on a stock. In this case it is existing holders, and not the company, selling shares, meaning QuantumScape would get no cash from the offering. But existing shares could feel some near-term downward pressure (which they have since mid-late December).

· We'll likely know when the registration becomes official (probably sometime January) when we see a spike in the volume of shares traded and probably another down day for the shares (likely the increase in volume and decrease in price mentioned on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) on the 4th). It's hard to read too much into options pricing, but if options are to be believed some investors are pricing in the potential for the stock to lose $20 or more in the weeks to come.

· QuantumScape was a breath of fresh air as it hit the public markets after its [reverse merger](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/13/why-kensington-capital-is-charging-higher-today/) with Kensington Acquisition Corp. in November.

· QuantumScape, in partnership with **Volkswagen**, expects to begin construction of a 1-gigawatt hour (GWh) pilot facility in 2021. If successful, QuantumScape will expand the project to a 20-GWh facility. To put this in perspective, consider that in mid-2018 Tesla reported that battery production of its Gigafactory in Nevada achieved annualized battery production of about 20 GWh.

· While management foresees the company reporting $275 million in revenue and $73 million in gross profit for 2026, QuantumScape estimates that the following year, the top line and gross profit will skyrocket to $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Likewise, the company believes that 2027 will be the year it starts to report positive [EBITDA](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/ebitda.aspx) \-- approximately $808 million.

·  Since 2012, Volkswagen has provided more than $300 million in funding to QuantumScape, making it the company's largest investor -- though it maintains a minority stake. In 2018, Volkswagen and QuantumScape formed a 50/50 joint venture, one of the goals of which is to produce solid-state batteries for Volkswagen's EVs on a mass scale.

· Thanks to the joint venture and pilot facility, QuantumScape envisions that Volkswagen will be the first to commercialize its solid-state batteries. But QuantumScape demonstrated in a recent filing that its dance card is hardly full, stating that ""subject to the other terms of the joint venture arrangements, we are not limited from working in parallel with other automotive OEMs to commercialize our technology.""

· While QuantumScape is singularly focused on developing its solid-state batteries for EVs, the company recognizes that its technology may be used in other applications, such as stationary storage, smartphones, and wearables. While the company may, in time, pursue the latter two markets, it seems that stationary storage is closest to the company's current focus; moreover, it's one that certainly represents a significant opportunity. According to Lux Research, the stationary storage market, which represented installations of 164 GWh in 2019, is expected to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate through 2035, when it will reach installations totaling 3,046 GWh.

· Apple has a [mountain of cash](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/cash-is-king/), and one could speculate that it would acquire a company with the right technology. QuantumScape highlighted its technology in a presentation earlier this month. The solid-state technology charges to 80% capacity in just 15 minutes, has greater than a 300 mile range, has a long usage life, and is non-combustible.

· The company is notably backed by both **Volkswagen** ([OTC:VWAGY](https://www.fool.com/quote/otc/volkswagen-aktiengesellschaft/vwagy/)) and Bill Gates. Whether investors are speculating about an Apple investment is anyone's guess. Moves could also be driven by thinking that other potential customers will want to partner with QuantumScape if they have to compete against an Apple EV.

&amp;#x200B;

*After this, I went to Simply Wall St. to get an overview of management and financials:*

## ·Shahmoon Keller PLLC Files Suit on Behalf of Holders of QuantumScape Corporation Warrants

· Shahmoon Keller PLLC announced that the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Manhattan has scheduled an injunction hearing for January 19, 2021 in a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of warrants to purchase stock of QuantumScape Corporation. QuantumScape, the successor to Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. by virtue of a business combination that closed on November 25, 2020, stated in its proxy statement and prospectus that the warrants “will become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of the Business Combination. QuantumScape subsequently asserted that the warrants could not be exercised until June 30, 2021, at the earliest.

&amp;#x200B;

*Their management is excellently qualified and highly respected in their field of expertise, with many years experience and strong motivation. At the minimum this is evident in their Co-Founder:*

· Mr. Jagdeep Singh is a Co-Founder of QuantumScape Corporation since May 2010 and has been its Chief Executive Officer and Director since May 2010 and serves as its Chairman since November 2020. Prior to that, Mr. Singh served as the President and General Manager of CIENA Corporation's Core Switching Division. He co-founded Infinera Corporation in 2001 and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer from January 2001 to December 31, 2009. He was the Founder of OnFiber and served as its Chief Executive Officer. He was the Founder of Lightera Networks and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer. He served as the Chairman of Onfiber Communications Inc. He served as Chairman of Infinera Corporation from March 2001 to October 14, 2010 and Executive Chairman from January 2010 to October 2010. He serves as a Member of Policy Board at EsNet, Inc. He serves as a Member of the Advisory Council at Stanford Graduate School of Business. He serves as a Member of Advisory Board of RWI Ventures. He served as a Director of Infinera until October 2010. He served as a Director of CIENA. Mr. Singh holds an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley, and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Maryland.

* Over 50% of current shares are held by either insiders, institutions, public companies or Venture Capitalist Firms.
* Top 15 shareholders own 57.19% of the companies shares. Among the top 15 include the likes of:

1. Porsche automobil Holding, with 19.56% ownership,
2. Khosla Ventures LLC, with 9.76%,
3. Capricorn Investment LLC, with 6.71%
4. L. Doerr , with 5.59% and
5. Jagdeep Singh with 4.84%.

&amp;#x200B;

*Next, I filtered through a Google search, focusing on news involving QS or its shareholders. This is what I found:*

&amp;#x200B;

* NEW YORK, Jan. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman &amp; Herz LLP**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxinmXVVLrJDxKXZ51kUy069jt6KYCVWfxv-xmrrVleGnnjI41ZIjHtVkE7V1tBU-F7u6qoBkkbZq2k4sxaA3WGwbEZTD6Y14D4iXLD4nmgqDb) announces that it has commenced an investigation of QuantumScape Corporation (“QuantumScape” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: QS) on behalf of investors concerning the Company’s possible violations of federal securities laws.

&amp;#x200B;

* On January 4, 2021, *Seeking Alpha* published an article pointing to several risks with QuantumScape’s solid state batteries that make it *“completely unacceptable for real world field electric vehicles.”* Specifically, it stated that the battery’s power means it “*will only last for 260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving.”* As solid state batteries are temperature sensitive, *“the power and cycle tests at 30 and 45 degrees above would have been significantly worse if run even a few degrees lower.”*

On this news, the Company’s stock price fell almost 40% during intraday trading on January 4, 2021.

[**Wolf Haldenstein**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxilkDLpHhrmI0w9pWxLiwZxzgbfa0LW6wu-ssajWNDjgU-zgz7CpsCaXj9SXd2mcPUg==) has extensive experience in the prosecution of securities class actions and derivative litigation in state and federal trial and appellate courts across the country. The firm has attorneys in various practice areas and offices in New York, Chicago and San Diego. The reputation and expertise of this firm in shareholder and other class litigation has been repeatedly recognized by the courts, which have appointed it to major positions in complex securities multi-district and consolidated litigation.

&amp;#x200B;

* MILWAUKEE, Jan. 4, 2021 /Newswire/ -- Ademi LLP is investigating possible securities fraud claims against QuantumScape (NASDAQ: QS) resulting from inaccurate statements QuantumScape made regarding its business operations and prospects.

Click here to learn more about the investigation: [http://ademilaw.com/case/quantumscape-corporation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3025642-1&amp;h=1038669832&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation).

The investigation focuses on whether QuantumScape properly disclosed the significant limitations of its solid-state battery products in order to be acceptable for real world field electric vehicle performance. Specifically, according to a Seeking Alpha research report, QuantumScape's solid state battery products (i) last only for ""260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving"", (ii) have a daily range of only about ""75-100 miles at full capacity in winter temperature conditions"", (iii) will charge only to 5% in 15 minutes rather than 80% at 15 minutes in winter conditions, and (iv) will have an energy density lower than competitors.

**Also of interest, I found a Bloomberg Article outlining all the key points from above, with bullish outlook:**

[https://archive.vn/Thdc8](https://archive.vn/Thdc8)

For anyone willing to dive deep enough, I recommend having a look through their patent applications on Google Patents here: [https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&amp;oq=Quantumscape&amp;sort=new&amp;page=1](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&amp;oq=Quantumscape&amp;sort=new&amp;page=1)

Also, a quick Google Scholar search on solid-state lithium batteries, should be enough to satisfy the battery nerds out there. Some really great articles, and research on this stuff, showing huge potential.

I also highly recommend everyone interested, to watch the following. It is the investors presentation, released on 8th December, on Youtube. It contains more information on their actual breakthrough btteries than I have above.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGnPSkXKb0I)

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, check out r/QuantumScape for even more dd if you desire.

&amp;#x200B;

My Tl;dr:

* Overall bullish, the tech, if all data and results are true representations, is extremely advanced. It will be the future.
* But production doesnt start until 2025 at the soonest. There have been accusations that the results and data were exaggerated, fabricated or whatever else usually follows success. Ongoing investigations are likely to turn up nothing though.
* Management and the board overall are extremely experienced and likely trustworthy. They are and will continue to be the best they can be at what they do.
* There are some extra shares floating around that may suppress price for a couple of weeks or so. And with a huge run up already after happening, it is unlikely to see another for a couple weeks/months again, minimum.
* People are comparing it to Tesla already. There are also some competitors, some of them Chinese, some of them just other car companies, such as Toyota and GM. Also EV stocks in general are hot/are getting bad rep because of valuations.
* In terms of technical analysis, I predict a big move upwards over the next few week/months.
* Long term (5+ years) this could go up 1,000% from current prices if they deliver on all their promises, and especially if they overdeliver. That would be extremely bullish.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, as a side note, I want to give a special mention to c.b.a.t (mods have banned because of market cap), another battery maker. All the hype surrounding EV's and Battery companies could cause c.b.a.t to go on a huge bullish run. For reference, it is already up around 30% over the last week or so, and could easily rise another 100%+ from here, with a current price of only \~$9. I am personally going long both.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you have all enjoyed my dd on QS, as much as I enjoyed putting it together! I hope to see big things from them in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

1610028728,57,0,FALSE,1610028797,1,"This is currently blowing my mind, so please, help me out here. There's this guy Tan Liu who has been pushing this idea that the majority of the stock market fits the legal definition of a Ponzi scheme. Yes, it would easily be the biggest financial crime in American history. Yes, its inflammatory and sounds like sensationalism. I know.

He's had little to no traction, for a couple years now. Wrote a book about it called The Ponzi Factor and has some compelling YouTube explainers. I've searched debunkings…expecting to hit a brick wall as usual with something as sensational as this, and to my surprise, I cannot for the life of me find anything convincing. I’m not a conspiracy guy (I can’t stand them actually) and I generally defer to convention. However, I can’t get this out of my brain. The bare logic of it seems inescapable to me and the implications are so large, I’ve just been fixated on it.

So I wrote this up because I'm curious to see what reddit thinks. It's only been discussed very briefly here and dismissed out-right without really thinking about what he's saying.

His basic argument is fundamental: Stocks are not ownership instruments if owners never receive money from the companies they own. This makes the majority of US stocks worthless, because only thing that gave them worth has been sneakily stripped away without affecting people's perception of their value. Perception meeting reality of course, would revalue much of the market to 0.

I'll try to break down the argument as concisely as possible… or at least as best as I’ve come to understand it.

**What gives a stock value, and why do we buy these things in the first place?**

When you buy a stock, you're buying a piece of the company… right? This is what I've always understood, and pretty much what everyone says. Stocks are an ""ownership instrument"". You own ""stock"" in a company. So, if they turn out to be successful - you make money too. Super basic. This is the fundamental assumption that makes stocks things people want to own.

And what makes owning a stock, owning part of a company? You can't just give someone a price of paper and call them an owner. There has to be some real, tangible benefit.

**So there are two things make stocks ownership instruments:**

1. They pay dividends. The company shares its profit with you via direct payments – the more the profit – the more the dividend. This is the one that matters. Money. Company makes money – you make money. Because you’re an owner. That’s why we’re here.
2. You get voting rights on major company decisions. (but if you're not getting paid - who cares? Are you buying stocks for voting rights in a company that doesn't pay you?)

The crazy part - the majority of today's stocks don't pay a dividend. They used to, but this has been slowly eroded since the turn of the century and heavily accelerated in the 1960s, championed by Warren Buffett. So, following this logic, if you took away dividends.... it would it mean a stock is NOT an ownership instrument...which would mean... *they're not a stock.* (this is where your bullshit detectors go off, I know, but just follow the logic)

The only reason you can sell the stock at a higher price later to another investor (capital gains), is because people value the stock. But *why* do they value the stock? They value the stocks because they are ownership instruments. They are ownership instruments because they pay a dividend. People still trade these non-dividend ""Ponzi assets"", as he calls them, on the marketplace and think they have value because...well... ???

So if you really digest this reality (or this is how it went for me), you think, how could this be true? Are people trading worthless pieces of paper like crazy people? Is my financial advisor ignorant or a shill? Is the smoke and mirrors so intense that everyone just follows along blindly? This can’t be, right? The implications are too crazy. What percentage of investors actually know about any of this?

He uses Google as an example. Google gives its class C shareholders no voting rights and pays no dividends Google states the ""par value” (the amount Google owes you for the stock) of each stock is $.001 US Dollars. So, what is Google selling when they sell you a stock? Why would people buy and sell these things? Why would human being put a monetary value of Google stock? Zoom out and think big picture. What do you actually own here?? This is the thing I can’t get out of my head.

But wait, this is crazy, you think, of course Google stocks have value. They’re freaking Google stocks. Say you bought one stock of Google early at $1, and now it's worth $1000, and you sold. Great investment. Well... where did the $999 come from when you sold the stock?

The answer is... some guy who bought it. Another investor just like you. Only because he believes that it is ownership instrument, and the thing he bought from you has value. And that investor is hoping that he'll sell it for even more, but the money he'll make....is just from another investor. This is buy low, hell high, or capital gains. This financial architecture, Tan argues, fits the SEC definition of a Ponzi Scheme.

So... if this guy is right - if you own Google stock… you own... a worthless, arbitrary thing that people believe have value. Their belief, of course, being the *only* thing that gives them value. A digital token that says Google on it - that has absolutely no financial link with the company. There is no logical reason it should track the success of the company. This is also a possible explanation for why the S&amp;P is back to 2019 highs. Analyzing Googles fundamentals is simply absolute insanity. The chain of money completely excludes Google's profits, mathematically and financially.

Just keep an open mind for a sec. If this logic checks out -- the only money to be made from Google stock never, ever, comes from Google's profits, but exclusively from the pockets of other people who have nothing to do with Google. therefore, Google's ability to make money doesn't matter - at all. The stocks' value are a complete illusion that we have assumed has to track with the company’s ability to turn a profit. That mechanic is only relevant… if you see some of those profits via dividends.

If people knew the truth, the value of their stock would crash to 0. There is no benefit to owning Google stock other than other people paying you for them. If you couldn’t make capital gains, think about it, what benefit would there be in owning Google stock?

Dividend stocks, however, are legitimate (unless of course they stop paying it- which they can - instantly tanking the real value to zero), and the author explains that dividends are supposed to be fundamental to stocks. Dividend stocks are a true ownership instrument, and in that case - capital gains make sense, because people are offering you money for something with real value - ownership. This is the true, sound mechanic of the stock market.

So further down this quarantine boredom fueled rabbit hole.. this is on his website and Instagram… a logic proof of why non-dividend stocks fit the SEC definition of a Ponzi scheme.

**S.E.C. Definition:** A Ponzi Scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.

**TPF Proof:** In practice, under foreseeable and non-hypothetical conditions, we can observe the following characteristics for non-dividend stocks.

1. Stocks are investment instruments.
2. Investors do not receive any money from the companies they own. The returns to existing investors—the realized capital gains—are strictly dependent on the funds contributed by new investors.
3. Investors think the returns come from the underlying business \[purported\].

The characteristics of non-dividend stocks meet all three technical elements in the definition. The word fraud is a subjective opinion word, not technical. Therefore, non-dividend stocks meet the SEC’s definition of a Ponzi scheme.

Ponzi schemes are illegal for many reasons, being they steal from the gullible/confused masses to benefit the few. Remember, Ponzi schemes produce winners towards the top of the pyramid. If you made capital gains, sure, you made money, but you took it from someone else, just like you. It is a net loss for investors.

And think about the crime here if true, the Ponzi scam simply vacuums up money from investors and concentrates them into corporate pockets and early investors (top of the pyramid). Taking away the dividend of course is denying another payment to investors. So, in essence, if true, this has just been just sneakily orchestrated systematic theft. And if/when the house of cards collapses, the top of the pyramid takes the money and runs. Is this real, reddit? Please let’s keep it logical please and not attack eachother. And please avoid jargon soup if you can!

Also to save some time, because yes I did Google this before posting, here are some common counter arguments I’ve found and Tan’s responses (that seem solid to me).

* Dividends “could” be paid in the future: Hypotheticals aren’t reality. What matters is the reality right now.
* The value of money is just a belief as well. No, because money is legal tender, backed by law. Companies print stocks to get money, and investors buy stocks because they want money. This puts fiat money and stocks on completely different hierarchies.
* He’s just selling a book: The book is non-profit, and he gives away a digital copy (Reddit doesn't allow bitly links!)
* Stock buybacks – companies dilute shares when they buyback, counteracting the benefit.
* Voting gives them value because you can vote for them to pay dividends. It’s a democracy! – companies can issue more shares and tip the scales whenever they want.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kse0qz/soam_i_crazy_or_did_this_guy_prove_the_stock/,,1/7/2021,14:12:08,9:12:08 AM,9:12:08

4 Steel Stocks Set to Gain on Spurred Up Demand in 2021

Mentioned:	MT RYI SC.HN ZEUS

The steel industry in the United States now seems poised to make a comeback from the COVID-19 led slump during the earlier part of last year. Demand for the metal is gradually returning as manufacturers are springing to action. Notably, increased demand has led to higher steel prices. Per S&amp;P Global Platts, the benchmark price for hot-rolled steel hit a two-year high of $900 per ton in December 2020, as mentioned in a Wall Street Journal article.

Moreover, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported that in the week ending Jan 2, production increased 3.1% from the week ending Dec 26, 2020. Capacity utilization also improved to 80.1% from the previous week’s capacity utilization of 72.3%. Although weekly productions were down on a year-over-year basis, the uptick in production from the prior holiday-induced week bodes well.

Reflective of the uptick in demand for steel, manufacturing activity has also been expanding in the United States. Per the latest report from the Institute for Supply Management, the purchasing manager’s index for December was 60.7% compared to 57.5% in November, marking the eighth consecutive month of growth.

Meanwhile, the World Steel Association (“worldsteel”) also forecast in a report that global demand for steel will rise 4.1% in 2021 following an estimated slump of 2.4% in 2020. Moreover, worldsteel predicted that demand for steel in the United States should increase 6.6% in 2021 following an estimated drop of 15.8% in 2020.

Separately, global production of light vehicles is expected to rebound in 2021. This rebound will be important because the automotive industry is a major contributor to demand for steel. Notably, IHS Markit estimated global light vehicle production to rebound 14% to 84.3 million units in 2021, following an estimated dip of 17% in 2020, as quoted in a Business Wire article. The article further mentioned that in North America, IHS Markit forecast a production increase of 29% on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of 2021 following a cautious view of the first quarter.

&gt; * Ahead of Friday’s government employment report, the ADP’s look at December jobs trends at U.S. companies showed a contraction in private-sector positions for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus. Throughout most of the pandemic, the ADP estimates have been below the final government count.

&gt; # 2. 10-year Treasury yield above 1%; bitcoin above $38,000

&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% on Thursday morning after projected wins for Democrats in both Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Lightening up on bonds, pushing prices down and yields up, investors bought riskier assets like stocks and bitcoin.

&gt; * The world’s largest cryptocurrency smashed through the $38,000 mark to hit a record high on Thursday as it continued its massive rally. Bitcoin has been up about 29% in the first days of 2021 and is up 380% over the past 12 months.

&gt; # 3. Congress confirms Biden as next president

&gt; * Congress early Thursday confirmed the Electoral College vote for Biden, a day after Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a chaotic effort to avoid the formal recognition that the president lost the election. Shortly after the confirmation, White House spokesman Dan Scavino tweeted Trump’s statement, which promised “an orderly transition on January 20th,” the day of Biden’s inauguration, but also perpetuated the baseless claim that he actually won.

&gt; * Congress’ process of counting Electoral College votes was interrupted Wednesday afternoon when rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building. A woman who was among the invaders was shot and killed by Capitol Police. Three other people died from medical emergencies.

&gt; # 4. U.S. trade group asks Pence to ‘seriously consider’ invoking 25th Amendment

&gt; * The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade organization representing 14,000 U.S. companies, called on Vice President Mike Pence to “seriously consider” invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office. Jay Timmons, CEO of the manufacturers group, is a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Two Democratic U.S. representatives worked on a letter to Pence requesting he invoke the amendment.

&gt; * Members of Trump’s Cabinet issued harsh rebukes of the violence that unfolded at the Capitol. The officials, however, stopped short of criticizing the president, who had urged his supporters to take action at a pro-Trump rally Wednesday morning.

&gt; * An administration official confirmed to CNBC’s Eamon Javers that National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien and Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger are considering resigning over the insurrection. Stephanie Grisham, chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump, and Sarah Matthews, White House deputy press secretary, both resigned Wednesday.

&gt; * Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former chief of staff, announced on CNBC on Thursday he is resigning as special envoy to Northern Ireland.

*****

&gt; # 5. Democrats win the majority in the Senate

&gt; * During the Capitol siege, Democrat Jon Ossoff was projected as the winner of the second of two Senate runoff elections Tuesday in Georgia. The defeat of Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday, coupled with Democrat Raphael Warnock’s projected victory over Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, splits the 100 Senate right down the middle. However, Democrats take over the majority as Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote. After Biden’s inauguration, Democrats will control the Senate, House and the White House.

All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn’t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.

Yesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Banks , Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which show how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Banks, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.

Yesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.

In some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.

While in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business.

[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.

In some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.

So, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.

We also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.

We also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.

And on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would benefit them.

[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.

On the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continuing to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.

My opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn’t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way, though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished higher and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn’t base your investment on this.

1610024357,95,0,FALSE,1610024369,1,"Tired of seeing ICLN and TAN posts and feeling FOMO because you missed the rocketship ETF? Well, look no further than QQQJ, an ETF which tracks the NASDAQ Next Gen 100 Index (the next 100 NASDAQ companies after the ones in QQQ). 🚀🚀🚀

As expectations for an economic recovery increase due to the incoming Biden administration, we should see continued growth in the stocks that comprise QQQJ, more so than the large-caps that comprise QQQ. This evidence can be seen by backtesting data provided on the NASDAQ website, which compares the performance of QQQJ against other mid-cap fund performance.

[Backtested 1-year returns](https://preview.redd.it/6m82eh2lnw961.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c7851affb4a37b06d998d79be2c22780a1e58a2)

Some of its more well-known holdings include recently beat-down companies such as:

* ROKU (down 5% from December highs)
* TTD (down 20% from December highs)
* BYND (down 18% from December highs)
* DKNG (down 10% from December highs)

Despite this beatdown of its more famous holdings, it's still almost back to pre-December crash highs. More importantly, the premiums on its calls are still lower compared to other similarly priced ETFs.

The incoming volatility from the swearing in of a new president should also cause

But won't growth be limited because companies will move into QQQ as soon as they grow? Not necessarily - in a bull market, all stonks go up, including those in QQQ. If all stonks are going up, then everyone wins, but QQQJ wins more.

# More confirmation bias:

Below is some historic data showing what happens when we have a Democratic president and a split or Republican-led Congress. Combine this with the Roaring Twenties, vaccine hopes, stimulus hopes, economic recovery hopes, and super hot growth potential in healthcare, tech, IT etc, and QQQJ i 

https://preview.redd.it/fwy5xioxkw961.png?width=789&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a9f4fa13509d8e06e9881b24e9515e7a14c1b17

# Charts

I've done some rudimentary crayon analysis on Tradingview, and as you all can see, we should see QQQJ at 35 sometime around March. This is based on the most bearish analysis I could find based on its current trend and macroeconomic conditions. As you can see, it's shown relatively stable growth thus far (aside from the crash in December).

[Rudimentary Bearish Crayon Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/cgpw2lo6kw961.png?width=1060&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a97dcfa2c8937b07dd5f9fcd903e28a568180e1d)

Alternatively, we could see hyper growth as the stocks in the Next Gen 100 Index rally based on an optimistic outlook from the potential redo of the Roaring Twenties, vaccine hopes, stimulus hopes, economic recovery hopes, and super hot growth potential in healthcare, tech, IT etc. Below is my best bull-case TA drawing:

[Advanced Bull Crayon Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/g6oe3niaow961.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d867780073995d921ef7170fec0e9ae7a1371ee0)

# HERE'S THE KEY POINT

Some of QQQJ's holdings recently suffered major beatdowns and are poised for recovery.

Premiums are higher than they were two weeks ago but still undervalued compared to similarly priced ETFs. June 35cs are going for $1.10 right now. 

Based on my ~~astrology~~ TA predictions, these should be ITM by March/April, at which time you can either sell the calls or just exercise them and sell the shares.

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. on Thursday logged a third-quarter loss and a smaller adjusted profit than analysts had forecast, as the company's in-store sales declined during the continuing pandemic.     

E-commerce revenue grew 77% on a comparable basis, while comparable-store sales fell 15%.     

The Union, N.J., the home-goods retailer reported a net loss of $75.4 million,        or 61 cents a share. In the prior-year quarter, the company's loss was $38.6 million, or 31 cents a share.     

On an adjusted basis, Bed        Bath &amp; Beyond posted a profit of eight cents a        share. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast an adjusted profit of 19        cents a share.     

Revenue was $2.62 billion, down from $2.76 billion a year earlier. Analysts had been expecting revenue of $2.75        billion.     

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond attributed the decline in sales to its move away from noncore banners, and to store closures. The growth in digital sales continued a trend that has strengthened since last year as more people shopped from home during the coronavirus pandemic. The company said its core Bed Bath &amp;        Beyond banner gained about 2.2 million new online customers in the quarter.     

Comparable sales grew 2% overall, it said.     

The company said gross margin improved to 36.5% in the quarter as the company adjusted promotions and markdowns, and achieved a more-favorable product mix. This was partially offset by high shipping costs as more sales involved sending products directly to customers' homes, Bed        Bath &amp; Beyond said.

&amp;#x200B;

PLTR will have many ups and downs. The key to diamond hands is conviction. This worked for Tesla and will work for any other stock.

The best way to form an opinion is to have two imaginary people take the extrem limits of an argument and let them discuss, because the truth is somewhere in the middle.

In order to do that I want you to form the absolute bear case for Palantir.

Once an opinion gets ripped apart and still stands it become conviction, which makes it easy to diamond hand shares.

Why should you not invest in Palantir?

Why is it a bad company with no bright future?

What are your strongest arguments against PLTR?

No B2C? Scaling ability?

I am referring to the company model itself and its monetization not to the stock price.

I hope this post will not get removed and will create discussions outside of the nearly unmoderated pump and dump that is happening in the daily at the moment.

To clarify: I am very bullish on PLTR and expect a $200B marketcap in the future and will invest after the lockup period.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksayv7/palantir_know_your_enemy/,,1/7/2021,10:52:08,5:52:08 AM,5:52:08

Dems now control everything and weed will be at the top of their agenda.  Why?  Because we spent 10T in the last 4 years and it's time we paid the piper.  They will tax the shit out of weed and it will be a multi-centi-billi-industry.  Capiche?

On top of which, the Dems are all about social justice and will want to decriminalize weed ASAP.  There's already 40+ states where weed is legal in one form or another.  Our neighbors Canada have been smoking it up legally for over 2 years now and Mexico is on the verge of legalizing (it will happen this year!).  

For those just wanting to dip their toe in the water, go ETF.  MSOS if you want to play US MSO (multi-state-operators) and why wouldn't you.  They've been on literal fire all last year.   Or if you want to stick with Canadian LPs (Licensed Providers) that are licking their chops over the US market then MJ or YOLO is what you want.  For the wsb crowd, you can say you YOLO'd and still feel secure knowing you're in an ETF and going broke like you would otherwise.

You want picks?  I got picks.  US players can only trade on OTC b/c of the whole federally illegal thing (stupid right??) but really anything is decent.  Curaleaf, Trulief, Green Thumb, Cresco Labs, Terrascend, to name a few.  My only qualm with US names (and it's a small one) is that these guys are already valued at multi billions, BUT they're all making money and so there's still very much room to grow.

On the Canadian side, nothing beats Village Farms in my book (only LP making money right now and that will probably stay true through all of 2021).  But CGC, APHA, TLRY, and even ACB ran up 10-20% yesterday alone (note: many are well shorted so some of that may have been squeeze driven).  They are all chomping at the bit to get into the states (which presents some downside for MSO but the US will be a monster so plenty of room for everyone) and will go crazy WHEN (not IF) that announcement comes THIS YEAR (I'm calling it!)

Anyways, bottom line is:  GET YOUR ASSES into weedstocks RIGHT NOW or you'll be crying a river about how you missed the boat in a few months and we'll all be laughing at you while you serve us our mohitos.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ksaq63/weedstocks_went_bananas_on_ga_runoff_and_looks/,,1/7/2021,10:33:06,5:33:06 AM,5:33:06

However I could only always read them on Desktop, since they were clearly not optimized for Mobile consumption. Whenever I was waiting somewhere and felt like doing something productive I tried to read reports on my phone but it always felt like still wasting time since the hardest part was to actually read the lines.

Therefore I created Stox a free iOS App that fetches SEC Reports and makes them adaptive to Mobile Devices. It’s super easy to read reports of all Public US Companies with it.

Also I plan to add push notifications on custom stocks whenever they publish a report in a few weeks as well as extracted tables of balance sheets, cashflow and income statements.

I am constantly trying to improve the tool so I would appreciate every feedback or feature request I can get.

For all Android and Desktop users:
I also created a website that does the same, it’s called fintopy.com
It makes reports look really nice and much easier to read even on Desktop

Man blackberry, who the hell thought I’d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you’re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.

It is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing. Let’s begin:

BB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. 

Technically, this thing is a fucking beauty. MACD flip, Stoch RSI cross, volume died on the sells and the thing is pushing up just the market died twice while it had solid momentum. This is going to move soon, but let's go away from crayons and into the magical land of make believe, news events, conferences, and fundamentals. It's not just two letters, it's a business. https://www.tradingview.com/x/uI3Cl51F/ 

**Recent Earnings**

Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast| % Surprise
---|---|----|----|----
Nov 2020| 12/17/2020| 0.1 | -0.04| 100
Aug 2020| 09/24/2020| 0.1| -0.02| 600
May 2020| 06/24/2020| 0| -0.04| 100
Feb 2020| 03/31/2020| 0.06| 0.01| 500



Surprises along the board.

* Revenues last quarter, $224 MM.
* Revenues projected for Q4, $246 MM.
* Full year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. 
* Mkt cap, $4 B. 
Total company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.



Saw this cute image of CRWD PLTR and SNOW, all with similar or lower Revs but SNOW is half but worth 20x BB, CRWD has less revs but is operating at 11.75x, PLTR (WSB fav) has 50M more projected annual revs and is worth 11x. Alright who cares about revenue, that's only today. If only it accounted for the big event happening in the next 9 days (see news events below).

**NEWS EVENTS**

*FB settlement*

I’m not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf 

This FB settlement is not included in earnings expectations, meaning THAT SHIT GOES UP or will be in analyst projections.

*BlackBerry IVY - Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform*

The big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”

What does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers?)

**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**

BlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:

Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences
Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models
Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge &amp; reducing raw data transmission
Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access
Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community

Want a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info? https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws Read this and watch their conferences coming up.

**Partnerships with big companies**

Blackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and some other company that I forgot. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY you dumbasses.

Patents
BB started offloading old patents but have one that will be important as of recent, with the sexiest one being this: https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10880812 

Very pretty stuff, big sex.


**Business Implications**

BB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?

Bubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).

**CONFERENCES**  

BB is speaking at the following conferences:

Citi’s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference - Thursday January 7th, 2021 at 1 PM with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

JP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum
Tuesday January 12th, 2021 at 5:45 PM ET 
with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) 

Needham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference 
Friday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15 pm ET 
With Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect &amp; Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect 

This was just announced and you bet your ass this will pump this stock up.



**Conclusion:**

This stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. This shit trades at $6.70 and is so close to going up if the market just doesn’t crash in the interim. They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile applications, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. 

I think this goes to lower PT of $10 by May, more likely $15. uThInKitWiLLdOUbleINmKTcAp???? Yes you fucking idiot, this is trading at 4X sales only, will be profitable this year, and has so much shit coming up. This is UNDER 4B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just buy the stock and sit on it. Want options? Buy them too. Have fun guys, I hope you all make money.

My positions:

29 contracts Feb $7C, bought as recently as yesterday.
1300 Shares, price avg of $7.001. I could have actively traded this prior to ER but decided to long term hold cause I am not a daytrader, and I fully believe in this hypothesis. I wouldn’t be typing this shit if not. Enjoy, go make money",0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ks4s3s/bb_king_the_blast_from_the_past_with_the/,,1/7/2021,3:40:22,10:40:22 PM,22:40:22

1609989174,22,0,FALSE,1609990352,2," **VectoIQ Acquisition Corp. II** **Acquisition Corp. II** announced the pricing of its $300 million IPO this evening and its units are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol “VTIQU” Thursday, January 7. Expected price entry for public investors is $10.

The new company aims to combine with an industrial technology, transportation or smart mobility business in the middle market. VectoIQ II is led by CEO Stephen Girsky, President and COO Mary Chan and CFO Steve Shindler.

Total SPAC deal count for 2021 year-to-date is now nine with $2 billion in gross proceeds raised. This offering is expected to close on Monday, January 11.

The company is led by CEO and Director Stephen Girsky, founder and Managing Partner of VectoIQ, Chairman of Nikola, and former Vice Chairman of General Motors; CFO Steve Shindler, a Director and former CEO of Latin American mobile telecom provider NII Holdings (Nasdaq: NIHD); and COO Mary Chan, a Managing Partner at VectoIQ and former President of Global Connected Consumer at GM. The company plans to target the industrial technology, transportation, and smart mobility industries.

The group's previous SPAC, VectoIQ Acquisition, went public in May 2018 and completed its acquisition of Nikola (NKLA) in June 2020. Nikola common stock closed Wednesday at $16.20, a solid premium over its original $10 offer price, but well below the high of $79.73 it achieved last June.

Potential “hail mary theory:” If Tusimple does successfully go public in the US, it would be the first self-driving company in the world to do so on a major financial market. The initial public offering (IPO) could also blaze a trail for peers in need of capital.

The company expects to achieve profit with an unmanned fleet of 5,000 trucks with revenue of $300 million annually, according to Chen. It currently pilots autonomous trucking services with 70 roborigs on the highways of several cities in Arizona and Texas.

Risks: Market is oversaturated with IPO’s funded by SPAC’s - upwards of 25% this year.

The IPO would test investor appetite for risk as the development of robocar technology has been slower than expected.

Lend me your ears!!!!

I come before you, on the eve of our great endeavor, to spread the word and the glad tidings. Our blessed flower has been given a clear runway and is finally ready to soar to the moon 🚀 The years have been long and we have waited. We’ve all blown a pretty penny on weed (and maybe the stocks too). Is it not time for us to reap the rewards for having invested so much!?!

I say YES!!!! 

Bring me those Tendies and roll up a fat one! Cannabis stocks are here to stay!!!

In all seriousness though:

As soon as it is decriminalized federally (which it will be due to the massive upset in Georgia), interstate commerce can commence as well as international trade with our neighbors to the north and south, who have also legalized (Mexico recently). It will sky rocket and all the “conservatives” will wonder how all the potheads got so rich suddenly.

Biden and Harris have admitted to their error in voting against cannabis in the past. I also believe that Biden will tout legalizing cannabis as one of his major achievements for his first 100 days. Which means they will pressure all those around them to vote to pass.

Plus, why not legalize and tax it federally? We are kinda in the middle of a pandemic and the economy needs all the help it can get.

The only ones who don’t want it legalized are crusty old farts. Support is huge for the green. 

Jump in now!

All calls on TLRY. It’s the largest cannabis corporation in the world thanks to it’s recent merger. 

Nothing goes better with smoke and nuggies than a fat stack of cash (or big numbers on a screen, cuz I’m gonna blow it all next week on calls).",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ks3lno/cannabis_and_tendies/,,1/7/2021,2:35:28,9:35:28 PM,21:35:28

The Democrat's now own the White House and Congress. This means that Biden's plan to put solar panels on all aquatic life and to switch to unicycles for all local travel is getting underway soon. Like or not, TSLA and NIO will now require 50 year commitment contracts for all new babies born after 2021 to exclusively purchase cars and stock for them after they are inoculated with locator GPS chips with COVID-20 vaccines.

We are entering a new age of Market bubbles with EV's and Environmental plays. For those who remember the bubble of the late 2000's, this bubble will make so many millionaires that Regis Philbin will role in his grave. Because unlike the 2000's bubble, this wont pop, at least until after you've profited so much you'll be in a position to reminisce to your grandkids about how hard you worked to get where you are and tell them they are entitled and that they don't need a livable wage of $500/hr to survive.

The play was JMIA, this company is severely undervalued and isn’t based out of the US so the Biden admin with a Democratic Congress essentially isn’t a threat to margins and profits.

Worth noting now leaps are great as well and I recommend you get in before it’s too late.

Anyways their 2nd capital raise was necessary to become the conglomerate they want to become and I was bullish but after that recent one I became extremely bullish.

So what was the play? Loaded 150 JMIA Jan. 15 $40’s a minute before market close. We’ll see who wins this one.. had to roll over the 500% $GS $280 calls after yesterday and today.

ALSO my FREE ADVICE to you so you can see the same return I did today on $GS. I recommend getting some $300 Jan. 8 calls at open.. $289 and it explodes to $301/$302 fast.

We all see it.  Day in and day out, diamond Squad and Gay Bears are in the heat of battle.  

We have the gayest of bears labeling GME a trash company.  “Who wants to shop for video games at an actual store when I can suckle them straight from Daddy Bezos’ tit?”  All the while, Diamond Squad is certain they will ride on the back of Ryan Cohen through the Great Squeeze of 2021 akin to the way a baby sloth hangs onto its mother.  

The bears are convinced a squeeze is impossible.  “Melvin and his band of cucks are literally wayyyyy smarter than all of you self proclaimed autists.  They know what they are getting into.  They are covering their shorts and making bank off of retards like yourselves.  Have fun eating ramen noodles warmed up with your own piss under an overpass.”  Unshaken Diamond Squad holds tight.  It is the only thing they know to do, hold tightly onto the back of mama and trust that she will bring you high into the canopy.

Here’s the thing.  Has the squeeze been squoze or are we going to be on Uranus by next Tuesday?  The squeeze is coming and here’s why.

Melvin and his band of cucks are going to keep shorting this until one of two things happens, GME goes out of business, or Mama Cohen slowly climbs into a secret rocket gifted to him from, you guessed it, Papa Elon himself.  

When Ryan Cohen takes over this company and turns it into a goldmine, the cucks will be in serious trouble.  No longer will shorts alone drive down price.  They can barely fight a battle against 1 million self proclaimed autists.  How will they ever stand a chance when everyone hops in on the fun?  Even the guys at /r/dividends will be getting wet thinking about the red and white letters we all know so well.

So that’s it guys.  It’s clear as day now.  Where are your chips?  This bet is going down in history and I know most of you will lose money on it somehow.  Cheers.",0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ks1tzw/gme/,,1/7/2021,1:00:50,8:00:50 PM,20:00:50

1609978905,109,0,FALSE,1609980533,32,"(*Editor's note: It's a wild day for the market and the country, and I will try to be as neutral as possible despite the fuckery afoot)*.

* Dems clinched the GA Senate run-off election as Warnock defeats Loeffler while Ossoff defeats Perdue (the first millennial Senator). As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. 

* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.

* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.

* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).

* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.

* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.

* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.

* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.

* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):

    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. 

    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. 

    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.

* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&amp;P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts. Stay in school kids and avoid storming federal buildings or Twitter will start banning your fucking account. (TWTR locks POTUS account for 12 hrs and is down -1.99% AH).

Do I regret not buying? Yes.

Do I regret not buying again in 2019? yes

Do I regret not buying again in 2020? yes

Will I regret for not buying it right now? Probably yes

&amp;#x200B;

But I still think it was overpriced all along, and I think that tesla will not become what you think it will. I'm probably the biggest fan of Elon and Tesla in this entire subreddit; but here is why you should reconsider the world domination price that its at right now:

**Just because it is a great product, doesn't mean that you will buy 5 cars.**

Why did the entire car industry soar in the last years? just because cars are getting electric doesn't mean that the industry should now be worth more. Sure, can now get money from selling the electricity to you, selling solar panels, or whatever. if Tesla won't face problems in China they will have a huge growth in the next 5 years, and the bubble will continue. But eventually, there will be nowhere to grow, and the stock will ""crush like a souffle"".

**Another very important point:**

When cars become full autonomous, most families won't have to own more than one car, It will just pick up everyone in separate times.

If you, your wife, and her boyfriend need to drive in concurrent  time to your jobs in the morning, it can just drop everyone where they need. I doubt that people will even own cars. Power will be so inexpensive, and no driver will be needed. I think that a concept like Amazon's zoox is much more viable in 10 years from now. Amazon can also easily make itself a taxi company by creating some kind of a new car, will the profits justify the valuation? as long as they will **absolutely dominate** China, India, Europe, and USA and won't grow (in terms of stonks) more than 3x in the next 10 years then I think it is cool. The problem is that with the craze that's going on I can absolutely believe that it will 3x this year alone.

Good bye everyone, see you in 2022 when I'll once again regret for not buying.",0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kryvg9/why_i_think_that_tesla_as_a_company_will_not/,,1/6/2021,22:29:12,5:29:12 PM,17:29:12

What a crazy day today, I almost was convinced that they were going to actually crucify someone on that giant cross they put up outside the senate. Just wanted to give a quick update on my positions and yolo status for anyone interested.

&amp;#x200B;

Original post:  

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqi6r9/weed\_stocks\_to\_the\_moon\_tomorrow/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqi6r9/weed_stocks_to_the_moon_tomorrow/)  

  

Update:  

I held all my weed call options after open, at 10am they were up $25,000 and it would have been an amazing profit. As you probably know, weed stocks kept going up and then shit themselves as soon as rioters stormed the senate.  Prior to this, /u/Unlikely-Trust1128 convinced me to sell off some of my gains for profits, so I sold 50 of my APHA 4/16 10c.  Thank you sir!!!

  

[10am weed stock diamond hands](https://preview.redd.it/xn9dyk2k9s961.png?width=1324&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6e14730ea2d0554505b591503b5e24ad89e309c)

I was tuning in live to YouTube ""Meet Kevin"" (Highly recommend) watching the presidential certification, which was cut off because protesters broke past the barriers. Things continued to escalate and at this point I felt a little uneasy. TLRY was still rocketing to the moon, so I decided to sell 20 TLRY 1/15 9c and 20 APHA 1/8 7.5c at the EXACT top.  I also bought 100 UVXY 1/8 10.5c

  

[Weed stock top \(just about\)](https://preview.redd.it/mbrnob8q9s961.png?width=1382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15a5979ab1c1eab28da2a56aba1b5f7deadff40c)

  

I paper handed the 100 UVXY for -$500, because nothing happened for like 5 minutes after I bought them, then UVXY shot up about 1 minute later. So what does your typical WSB autist do? I rebought 100 UVXY and sold those about 10 minutes later for a +$1,500 profit, so that trade somehow worked out lmao.

  

During this volatility, weed stocks absolutely shit themselves as America caught on fire. I watched 1/3 of my profits for the day vanish before my eyes in a single hour. After contemplating over and over again whether I should sell the remaining calls, I decided to just say fuck it and hold onto them. TLRY dropped so much, so fast, that I decided fuck it and bought back into my positions (slightly different) at a discount.

&amp;#x200B;

[Weed stock first bottom](https://preview.redd.it/avoxv1ahas961.png?width=1326&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4365870a6bb41cd89de5b94e18cff82baf49b376)

&amp;#x200B;

My reasoning for buying back in is that this is (hopefully) just going to be short term panic selling. IMO, weed stocks still look strong AF.  I have a lot of calls expiring Friday, so I'm hoping that this all blows over and gets sorted out TONIGHT. Dems are still going to win so I think this amount of sell of really was a huge overreaction, but I could be 100% wrong.... who knows. Below is a visual of my moves today (ON TLRY graph) as well as the new positions I am holding overnight. Thanks for the support everyone, here's to another night of no sleep!

1609959204,7,0,FALSE,1609959536,2,"My thought on TSLA...
I think it will go up little more from $770 range IMO, maybe reach $820 by Monday morning.  Eventually it will start going back down because no stock goes in one direction.  TSLA could drop back down to $700 range by 1/22.  I would never short TSLA even when I think it will go down.  I try to have enough cash available ready to buy more TSLA when it goes down.  My strategy is to keep all TSLA shares while playing with long term and short term options.  I have never sold a single share of TSLA.

What do you think about these two options play (only after price drop occurs by 1/22)?

1.  February 5, 2021 $800c 
2.  January 2023 $1400c 

I am definitely long in TSLA.  In two years, we could see $2000+.  This is just my personal PT so please do your own research and come up with your own idea.",0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kruf8p/tsla_going_up/,,1/6/2021,18:53:24,1:53:24 PM,13:53:24

Around then, $PLTR was booming, and I made $30 off of your brilliance. Then I made a mistake. The greatest mistake of my life thus far. I believed in meme stocks, and started investing in every meme stock there has been since, and made $10 here and there, slowly expanding my portfolio. Then a DD on Black Berry, which is now a cyber security company, working in the public and private sectors, including working with car company’s computer technology, caught my eye, and something about it made me put 80% of my money into it🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. Then it dropped from 8 to around 6 dollars, leaving me lost, hopeless, and almost penniless. But my emotions do not effect my hands, as they are diamond. So after hearing all of that, im sure your wondering, why not buy the dip like a sane autist and wait, because stocks only go up? The answer is, I can’t. My mommy thinks I am going to lose my life savings of a grand if I keep losing money like this, so she won’t add any more into my Robinhood account until she sees some green. So please, for the love of god, fuel those rockets up, support my gambling addiction, and SEND BLACK BERRY TO THE MOTHERFUCKIN MOON🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/krtgqp/bb_to_the_mooon/,,1/6/2021,18:10:21,1:10:21 PM,13:10:21

I’m very interested in this one. For those of you that aren’t familiar, it is an ETF with stakes of next gen tech companies, including 2.27% of ROKU. It was listed on Robinhood on October 13 at $26.79. It steadily dropped to a low of $24.67 on October 30. Until about December 22, we’ve had pretty steady growth. We’ve had short term correction and I think we’re entering another phase of steady growth.
In other words, the ETF is behaving how ETF oughta act. 
Here’s the cool part. The stock is currently sitting at Ab 31. A 35 dollar Call FOR JUNE 18 is priced at .48. That’s not it. It has an open interest of 22k and delta of .30.

**This ETF offers great exposure to:**

**The world's leading semiconductor manufacturer - TSMC (TSM)**
Wanna know who manufactures Apple's new killer chips? What about AMD's product line? NVDA's? Yup that's fucking right TSMC. Much cheaper options, with extremely low IV.  


**A Leading Emerging Market** - as they are expected to outperform: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/biden-fueled-emerging-stocks-rally-may-falter-by-inauguration?srnd=premium


**Depreciating Dollar as the fed printer goes BRRRRRR**
https://www.google.com/finance/quote/TWD-USD

To get an idea of how bright Taiwan's future looks let's take a look at how well they did during Covid. From the start of the pandemic until now, this country with a population of 24M has only had 819 TOTAL covid cases and 7 death! That's fucking right 7!!!!! Second Wave? No! Fucking WHAT PANDEMIC!?!?!??!


Risks? 
Gina - Currently distracted whipping it's domestic billionaire class into line. Taiwan political leadership wildly popular after successful covid response, not afraid to clap back at Gina's rhetoric.
Liquidity - This is a new ETF with only recently made available options - gotta drip in and out of positions, stay close to ATM to really minimize risk.

1609954446,33,0,FALSE,1609954723,2," $JOE is a company that owns large coastal Florida real estate. The market is on fire and benefitting hugely from the mass exodus of the rich from tax heavy states such as New York as well as the fear of inflation. \[[https://www.joe.com/video-gallery](https://www.joe.com/video-gallery)\] 

 $JOE owns about 170000 acres across Florida. The Company develops its land through segments comprising residential, resorts and leasing.  Fair value today is north of $100 and it likely trades for a few hundred a share over the next year.

It's latest SEC filing makes me extremely bullish. \[[https://ir.joe.com/node/18531/html](https://ir.joe.com/node/18531/html)\] 

It currently has an estimated earnings per share growth rate of 40%. Total revenue increased by approximately 28% to $42.0 million for the third quarter of 2020 as compared to $32.8 million for the third quarter of 2019.

This included a 37% increase in real estate revenue, a 22% increase in leasing revenue and a **21% increase in hospitality revenue.** A 21% increase in hospitality revenue, during COVID, not bad...

It trades at 4x book value. Even if the company stops making money and sells all it's land the shareholder will still get more back than what the stock currently trades at. 

Management has also been slowly buying back shares and this looks set to continue, in addition they've announced a new quarterly dividend program this year.

They are set to announce the sell out of one of their developments in the next few weeks and this will likely provide a catalyst. 

This stock will explode over the coming months. If you bought into the Hamptons 50+ years ago your family would have made an absolute fortune. Now is another opportunity.

PSTH - 20/30 spreads, 22.50/35 spreads and shares. I only open spreads to keep the same exposure with less capital due to tax stuff.

BFT and [BFTWS](https://BFT.WS) \- Shares and warrants. Standard options became available today and I do not own any.

I have reduced by BFT position slightly to buy some of the Theil SPAC.

I have rolled my PRPL short puts from January 30's to February 35's. I still believe the next leg up will put us in the high 30's or even the low 40's. I expect some type of press release soon as the company has been silent for a long time.

PSTH- anticipated announcement in Q1, hopefully January. The six month mark is Jan 22nd.

BFT- Expecting a merger date announcement soon. CNBC's Grasso is back from having the corona and he is pumping it again. That along with a few big twitter guys will keep this on a lot of peoples radar. Paysafe is a solid play IMO, even if it doesnt shoot to 30 post merger. I am optimistic that we see 17/18 per merger and 25 post merger. This is purely a guess.

All my other positions are small. I've posted them all above. And no, I don't own GME- it might be the play of the century but I think I missed the big run.

No EV SPAC has gone bad this far and this is way better than Fisker which means this won't be the first one that crashes and burns. They produce EV tucks and buses AND school buses. The market is $110 billion per year and the company is currently valued around $2 billion. This means they have plenty room to grow. 

Compared to Nikola these guys actually have trucks already being delivered. They have currently sold 300 units and Amazon is testing their trucks and if they like them it will be a rocket like you've never seen before. 

They are aiming for 6x revenue growth in 2021 and over 18000 units sold in 2024. Now you're thinking these are empty promises but let's say they're not that empty. Even if we half these numbers it's not a bad buy.

Also, they make their trucks from the ground up which makes them able to grow infinitely. They are the only ones that might compete with the Tesla semi.

They currently go under northern genesis acquisition co or NGA.

Ended up increasing my position by an extra 50 contracts, I'm now naked 250 x 16$puts for June expiry.

Shares are holding steady at 17 as investors are betting that they will have to increase their bid above 16.50 to take this baby private.

Puts are still changing hands at about .85-.90$, there's still some room to the play, although it's not as appealing as it was on Monday, I think you still have some room to make some easy money while you wait to see what the next meme stock is.

If you have limited margin available, you can open a credit spread selling the June 16$ puts and buying the 10, 11 or 12$ puts to reduce your margin requirement significantly.

The buyout offer is 50c above the strike, this has a VERY high likelihood of success.

More simply, who here would invest in a company that creates/profits off of pornography (I know 99% of you retards would)? If you answered yes, then MC AC is the stock for you. MC AC is a SPAC (we all love SPACs, don't we? which has already announced their DA to take **Playboy** public which is expected to **conclude early in Q1**. Additionally, it's currently trading at $10.51 which means their is only a **5% downside as SPACs have a $10 floor**. I expect the exact date to be announced very shortly (maybe in a week or so) which will cause the price to jump dramatically.

**Meme Potential/Revamped Business Model:**

Let’s acknowledge the obvious here: Playboy is extremely well-known brand with unlimited meme potential due to the nature of the business model. I was just talking to my 62 year old immigrant dad about Playboy and he knew more about them than I do. Who knows, we probably even beat off to the same Playmate before, and that’s the beauty of this stock. With Playboy being a house hold name, there will be endless coverage from networks, YouTubers, TikTokers, etc that will pump the shit out of this stock. We all know the potential of what a Cramer pump can do to these stocks. Shit, with how small MC AC’s float is, a pump by Cramer could honestly send this up 30%+ in minutes. No joke. Just imagine what a partnership with an A-list celebrity would do…

Playboy has completely changed their business model from magazines to four key revenue streams: Sexual Wellness, Style &amp; Apparel, Gaming &amp; Lifestyle, and Beauty &amp; Grooming. Each one of these revenue streams have attractive growth stories behind them simply due to the industry they’re in. People will be buying Playboy products just because of the name itself which saves them a fuckton on marketing expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

**Women lie, men lie, but number's dont:**

Many people believe Playboy is a dead brand and is a thing of the past. Those claims would be objectively false by conducting simple analysis of their recent financial statements/projected growth. In this graph, you can see that they plan on nearly quadrupling their revenue from their 2019 numbers. Speculation aside, Playboy recently announced their 2020 Q3 earnings and revenue rose by [86.2 YoY to 35M as well as posting 1.3M in net income](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/playboy-releases-three-nine-month-140500306.html). Additionally, being valued at a measly 385M market cap makes these numbers even more compelling representing a 1.3x 2025E revenue multiple.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reason why price hasn't moved:**

There have been several instances of SPACs running low under the radar and then running up extremely quickly when approaching merger. My hypothesis is since there was such an influx of SPACs in 2020, many were overlooked or simply unrecognized by retail traders and even institutional investors. For example, check out the charts of PIC (currently known as XL), RMG (currently known as RMO), OAC, etc.

According to [businesswire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005404/en/Playboy-to-Become-a-Public-Company), the merger is expected to happen early in Q1 which is rather soon. **Once the exact date is announced, expect some upwards price movement**. On top of this, there are NO OTHER SPACs that will be merging this time which brings all attention towards MC AC as SPAC investors will want to get their merger run-up fix. In my eyes, this play is literally free money so I’m balls deep so I can retire this year.

**Closing Statement:**

I’m trying to hand you guys the easiest money you’ll ever make. This is not a gimmick, there are no tricks here. I’m 100% sure there will be some sizable returns by merger. Also, before you people start making claims that Playboy is a “boomer” company, STOP RIGHT THERE. **This is not a good argument**. Simply put. The only thing that matters is Playboy’s name recognition, not their archaic business model which doesn’t even exist anymore as they have completely repurposed their business. Here is my position, I’m holding roughly 51k shares and even bought 10k shares in my mom’s retirement account LOL.

**TLDR: Buy MC AC commons, there are no warrants or options. MC AC is a SPAC that will be taking Playboy public valued at 400m market cap. Being a SPAC, there is a hard $10 floor so the downside is very limited with unlimited upside. Playboy is very much still relevant as can be seen by the following on their IG page, and has massive potential for a comeback story due to importance of the “Playboy” name. There should be endless pumps from networks, social media, etc. No longer just a magazine company as they’ve expanded their business model to encompass four key revenue streams: Sexual Wellness, Style &amp; Apparel, Gaming &amp; Lifestyle, and Beauty &amp; Grooming. Grew revenue 90% YoY in Q3 and is very profitable. MC AC expects to take public early Q1, and once they announce the exact date, this will be sent to the moon and continue to run-up till merger. I expect MC AC to be around $17-$20 by merger representing a 70%+ gain in roughly a month**",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/krqzha/the_next_meme_stonk_better_than_pornhubonlyfans/,,1/6/2021,16:17:06,11:17:06 AM,11:17:06

The vaccine supposedly will not work for this new strain, which i assume will shorten public desire for the Moderna or Pfizer Vaccines.

More simply, who here would invest in a company that creates/profits off of pornography (I know 99% of you retards would)? If you answered yes, then MC AC is the stock for you. MC AC is a SPAC (we all love SPACs, don't we? which has already announced their DA to take **Playboy** public which is expected to **conclude early in Q1**. Additionally, it's currently trading at $10.51 which means their is only a **5% downside as SPACs have a $10 floor**. I expect the exact date to be announced very shortly (maybe in a week or so) which will cause the price to jump dramatically. 

**Meme Potential/Revamped Business Model:**

Let’s acknowledge the obvious here: Playboy is extremely well-known brand with unlimited meme potential due to the nature of the business model. I was just talking to my 62 year old immigrant dad about Playboy and he knew more about them than I do. Who knows, we probably even beat off to the same Playmate before, and that’s the beauty of this stock. With Playboy being a house hold name, there will be endless coverage from networks, YouTubers, TikTokers, etc that will pump the shit out of this stock. We all know the potential of what a Cramer pump can do to these stocks. Shit, with how small MC AC’s float is, a pump by Cramer could honestly send this up 30%+ in minutes. No joke. Just imagine what a partnership with an A-list celebrity would do…

Playboy has completely changed their business model from magazines to four key revenue streams: Sexual Wellness, Style &amp; Apparel, Gaming &amp; Lifestyle, and Beauty &amp; Grooming. Each one of these revenue streams have attractive growth stories behind them simply due to the industry they’re in. People will be buying Playboy products just because of the name itself which saves them a fuckton on marketing expenses.

Xmas Present!! More $SKLZ DD inside!

Courtesy of The Great Correction 

Valuation Disparity...

U currently 800M in revenue.
SKLZ currently 250M in revenue.

250/800 = .31 or 31%

So SKLZ should be valued at 31% of U's current market cap based on total revenue.

U current market cap 45B

45(.31) = gives us SKLZ market cap with U's valuation... 14.06B

SKLZ current market cap... only 7B @ $20

14/7 = 2

We need to multiply the current share price by 2 to get to a 14B market cap.

2($20) = $40

So if SKLZ is just valued like it's peers, it's ALREADY a $40 stock WITHOUT the 100%+ growth they will experience over the next 24 months.

$80+ in 2022.

It's just math.

SKLZ is a BIG FAT gift here.

People will catch on eventually.

Good Luck.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, although i wrote my DD over a week ago and had decent positions, i mainly went in yesterday after close (at $19.70) and today morning (at $20.35) for another 600 shares. And I don't really regret any of this. It has been on a steady climb for a couple of days now. Last week the shorts pushed it down, probably trying to shake off more people and spread fear so they could buy in at a lower point. (worked vs. me, i got scared of the idiot crayon TA analysts that said it could go to 15, so i didnt buy the dip and waited for confirmation of runup.)

But last earnings it was the same, it wasn't too late by any means to get in right before earnings. 

From Sep. 21 to Sep. 30, the price went from \~$12.2 to \~$14.5, or a nearly 20% increase. Then it popped to \~$20.5 after earnings, or another \~30%. 2 weeks later it was at \~$25, or another 25%.

So, despite it running up 17% before earnings now, last time it gained another +50% on top of that after earnings. And, as the DD shows, this earnings should be even better. The thing is, shorts and investors seem to know this. The float and volume on this is way too high for retail to move it like this, it's not a meme stock anyway. So you still have today to get into this if you believe in the earnings.

On top of that, the CEO Mark tritton is no imbecile. They have literally hundrets of millions ($325m) to spend on share buybacks until the end of february. **What better point to create shareholder value than to present excellent earnings AND use a ton of the sharebuyback money to blow up the price at the same time?** This duality ensures that shorts start to sweat and the price goes up even more, and for good reason.

Compare this to JWN. They TRIPLED their share price in november due to better than expected earnings, and investors being optimistic about them surviving the pandemic.

The reason for 70% shorts for BBBY is that everyone expected them to not survive corona, or atleast heavily succumb under their garbage assets and dept. All of that has been taken care of. If BBBY shows again that they are on a sustainable road to profits again, this will fly. On this note, I won't sell for a couple weeks even if earnings do pop it 20%+, will wait for 50% at the least depending on earnings. Could be well another JWN in the makings.

&amp;#x200B;

Risks: Earnings miss. This is all, but based on the price movement, DD done and history, this should not happen.

1609942543,17,0,FALSE,1609942554,1,"Ok guys this post will serve as an update of the [RAVN DD that I posted last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k996yo/ravn_dd_a_hidden_cathy_ark_delight_free_crayon/), and where I expect the stock to go, and certain key buy/sell targets based on recent price action. 

If you’re interested in the company, [u/Nosefuroughtto](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nosefuroughtto/) provided an incredible overview of the different aspects of the business and Raven’s finances that I recommend you check out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ka1w6j/ravn_cathie_and_arkqs_next_baby/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

Since posting, the stock price peaked at around a 24% higher than the lows of December 8th and closed last trading day at $33, an 18% increase from the date of posting. GANG. This leaves us with an additional upside of 50% to return to the previous highs of $49 from August 2018. 

The Ark fund behaviors continue to show that RAVN has room to grow. ARKQ now holds over 500k shares, and has not disclosed any sell orders in their newsletters. [Bullish AF.](https://cathiesark.com/arkq-holdings-of-ravn) 🚀🚀🚀

In fact, just yesterday January 5th 23,201 shares were added to the fund. 

TA gives some good idea as to what to expect moving forward. Again, after the breakout identified in my previous post, RAVN mooned. Very similar 🚀🚀🚀 conditions are being shown now, and I would be confident buying at these levels.

As of now, we are consolidating around the $33 level. Solid support at $32.28, and I would buy at these levels, setting a stop loss/alert at just under. Premarket action as of this morning, January 6th, is indicating a breakout above the wedge today. Looking to see a close of a 4hr candle above the wedge to panic buy continue to hold until at least my 35 strikes are ITM.

Honestly, I think I hit a home run with this stock pick. People call me daddy now, and I’ve been getting PMs about people’s profits and it’s really heartwarming. GRWG mooned after I posted but I sold out of that wayy too early. Thus, I feel obligated to provide Raven gang with my moves and outlook for the future. Best of luck to you guys, and feel free to discuss the company’s outlook/bear perspective, love to see action under my DD’s.

Weed is the hottest industry on the market, now that it looks like democrats will control the entire government. Over the next few days, everything tangentially related to weed will moon **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** .

Unfortunately, the industry is massively diluted. While it will certainly rise as a whole, one weed stock will eat the rest, take all the profits, and send many competitors bankrupt.

Hydroponics, however (like HYFM, a stock I know some of you like) is much less diluted and will see a similar demand in growth as companies grow more and more weed. In short, they're gonna moon just the fucking same, and are much safer from a crash.**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.**

The stock is already up premarket. However, news agencies are still reporting that Ossof hasn't finished his race yet and that the Senate is up for grabs. This is bullshit. There's not a fucking chance that Ossof loses at this point, based on the breakdown of the \~73k votes remaining (absentee and deep blue Atlanta.) When this news comes in, the stock will continue to shoot higher. **🚀🚀🚀**

Not to mention, it's a goddamn American company. Right now, all the hot weed stocks are Canadian (because they legalized first). Really think it's gonna stay that way once American companies are given free reign? The stock is also highly rated with good fundamentals, and is rated as a buy across the board. Honestly, it'd be a decent bet no matter what. With the dems taking the senate (to be confirmed tomorrow at around noon), it's going to moon short and long term **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.**

Not a big contract ($8M) but a good example to follow. I don't expact PLTR to moon from this news, but it is nice to see contracts being signed. 

 

Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) announced today it was expanding its work with Fujitsu with a one-year, $8,000,000 contract between Fujitsu and Palantir Technologies Japan K.K. Fujitsu will also become the first distributor of Palantir’s Foundry platform modules in the Japanese market.

Fujitsu has used Palantir Foundry since last year to optimize its hardware supply chain, further improve its customer service efforts, and modernize its technological infrastructure, and will continue to do so until at least the end of 2021. Fujitsu will also become the first distributor within Japan of [ERP Suite](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.palantir.com%2Fjapan%2Fen.html&amp;esheet=52356376&amp;newsitemid=20210106005230&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=ERP+Suite&amp;index=1&amp;md5=631723c5d36cc6743ca3ca8fd7410e36), a Palantir Foundry module. Fujitsu is already using ERP Suite internally to integrate its ERP systems with other critical systems of record. This new module distribution channel will be accompanied by a Foundry certification program for Fujitsu’s DX services business.

Fujitsu’s distribution of Foundry modules will build on the company’s existing support of customers in their digital transformation journeys, as well as its experience working with large commercial institutions and all branches of the Japanese government.

as always, I‘m not buying anything before I hear the opinion of the wise people from WSB.

Foxconn - the biggest Apple supplier signed a deal with Byton for the production of Byton‘s first EV SUV planned for Q1 2020 named „M-Byte“. Foxconn is the same dude who also supplies some parts for TESLA cars.

https://invezz.com/news/2021/01/06/foxconn-stock-price-surges-after-cutting-a-new-production-deal-with-byton/

Byton is currently not publicly traded, but apparently the closest stock to them is a company called „China Harmony New Energy Auto Holding“ as they are the biggest stakeholder in Byton. They are trading around $0.3 at the moment, which is basically makes them a pennystock.

Therefore my question:

do you consider this China Harmony New Energy thing a good YOLO play? Byton is yet to produce their first car, but with the support of Foxconn and if everything goes well, this could become huge. Imagine buying 10k shares of NIO when they were trading under a dollar.. 

I just can’t find detailed information about how good this deal for China Harmony is. Their stock hasn’t really moved. Exactly the opposite, it fell a few % in the past weeks. 

I‘m expecting a profound and insightful WSB DD on China Harmony New Energy Auto Holding and their stake in Byton.

GME (Long term Bullish) - If you're not already in GME then I don't recommend playing until you see a break at 18.10 (ish) with heavy volume. If it breaks resistance look out for 18.97-19.74-20.5 range.

If current support fails, look GME to fill a gap at 16.55-15.77 range. If it breaks 15.77 support then we f'ed. Watchout for 14.5-13.50. Anything below 13.5 and that means Cohen probably died or something.

If it breaks 19.74 then we moon to 21-23 range for this week.

TSLA (Bullish): Expecting TSLA to head down to 748 range since it mooned after hours and is near resistance BUT it could hit 757-765-770 because it's TSLA. If green support line fails we could see 740-733-731 area but would need catalyst and volume. If it breaks out of support with no volume then it could trade around no-man's land for the rest of the week while our calles get the theta treatment.

I personally believe that the MSOs have the greatest potential. $MSOS is the easiest play, or check out it's holdings for ideas (sorry robinhood crowd, they're all OTC meaning $MSOS is your only play). 

Why US companies over Canadian?

1) The US market is WAY larger than Canada's. 
2) Cannabis being a schedule 1 substance has been a significant handcuff to MSOs (multi state operators).
3) US based companies have much more attractive financials. 

What does decriminalization do for MSOs?
1) Allows their products to cross state lines. The reason they are called MSOs is they have to silo operations in each state in which they operate. Any product bought in a dispensary is grown and processed in that state as well. Centralizing operations will lead to massive economy of scale improvement. 
2) Allows them to move from OTC markets to the NYSE/NASDAQ.
3) Allows them to use banks. Right now it is a cash business in most states except the few with specialized credit unions. This leads to overhead in security and cash management.

In generell I was also asking myself if now is really the right Moment for long term investments. Of course I also did some research before posting here so I know what ETFs etc are.

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021, as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green, lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%, while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities &amp; Real Estate just finished in the red.

Most small &amp; mid-cap value &amp; core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG), as large-caps did finish mostly flat.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market, with Big Tech companies advancing moderately, while most of the Oil&amp; Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.

The economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive, starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006, continuing the trend of this year, as this number, is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986, as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.

We also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6, higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders, productions, prices index &amp; supplier deliveries, while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month, standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020, with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year, with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis, as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).

[TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers, MBA mortgage applications, ADP jobs numbers, factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite, as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results, as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.

If the Dems to sweep, this could cause an increased volatility in the markets, especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion, as I believe it’s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes, which is very unlikely on big &amp; important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects, they wouldn’t do that when things are still very bad in the economy, and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any “big tax changes” or any other “big regulation changes”. So, if the Dems win the other seat, expect volatility, that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So, I just wouldn’t bet against the bull market that we are in right now.

In some other stock market news, we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again, following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation, with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction, but after all of this will pass, Alibaba is still a great company, even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs), with the latest big ones being Alipay &amp; WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah, maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get, but I really don’t think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.

Yesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers, with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show, with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year, as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020, while NISSAN’s [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop, as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter, as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%, as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.

Meanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020, but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4, as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more &amp; more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry, I suggest you take a look at the product development &amp; future outlook for the company before. I think both GM &amp; Ford are going in the right direction, but you should do your own research.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open, with the Dow leading the way, while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling &amp; portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.

I’m 19yo, i just finished college broke with my law and business grade As, got a job at a lawyers but they shut down due to corona within 6 weeks, I’ve just done nearly two months of unpaid work and i only have £350 to my name. 

I’ve worked since i was 15, takeaways, construction, stores, all sorts of junior jobs for crappy pay - my point is ive always worked hard but i can’t seem to catch a break. I’ve worked 14 hour days and even sold illegal substances before just to support my family.

I can’t complain about my life though, I’m in good health and I’ve been blessed with a gorgeous gf who I’ve been with for 3 years.

I don’t lack discipline or effort, every morning at 6am I’m up and i go for a jog, then i come back, shower and eat a green apple. I then tend to the daily chores such as washing, ironing etc, i help my parents around the house most of the day and i work out for at least 2 hours a day. I pass the time of being a useless bum by writing my fantasy book ( just a hobby ) creating lore for my world, playing Xbox and reading books to gain as much wisdom as possible that i can use to help people and myself. I calculate all my calories and i have no problem not eating sugary snacks even though i want to, I’ve stopped drinking any coffee etc. Again, my point is i have the drive and effort that all my friends lack, yet i am at the worst place out of them all. 

However, the reason I’m here:

My problem is this - 
 
1) i owe my gf £800 

2) I owe my grandparents £300

3)i can’t afford to buy my gf anything and I hate it because her smile is main thing that helped me out of my depressed state

4)I feel like I’ve lost my masculinity because all my mates have great jobs and lots of money ( mainly accountant apprentices etc) 

5)my parents business just tanked and we might have to move 

6) i want to get enough money to join my local political race

Why i am here:

I am asking for any help and advice on what i should invest in? or what i should do?

I know you are probably all too retarded to play chess. I get it. You can't read in the first place and probably lost me at my incredible ""DD"" already, so how would you know that pawns move straight and knights move.. however the fuck knights move.

Chess has a pretty prominent world champion called Magnus Carlsen. He is probably the best chess player of all time and frequently crushes everyone that stands in his way. Chess is on its way to become a mass sport currently, as the Netflix series ""The Queens Gambit"", the ""Pogchamps"" on Twitch and the very prominent Twitch streamer Hikaru Nakamura (who gets crushed by Carlsen a lot) all feature Chess and the new interest in chess e.g. let the demand on chess boards soar by 250% on eBay. A lot of new players are coming to the game and this is very beneficial to the following company you will put your money in without giving it a second thought: Play Magnus AS.

&amp;#x200B;

Play Magnus AS is the only publicly traded company that involves chess and therefore might profit a lot from the recent boom of the game. They have/offer plenty of applications to play, learn, watch, read or get coached in chess. Among chess players ""chessable"" and ""chess24"" are very common and the media coverage off all the tournament the Play Magnus group introduced gets views that are close to the moon (where the stonk will be soon).

The rapid growth the company faces is quiet astounding with YoY growth rates in mostly all segments off more than 100%. Revenue and bookings increased by 137% and 112% YoY, whereas the monthly paying users increased by 68%. At this point it's important to know that the market cap of 110mio. is already pretty big for a company that estimates revenue of 16mio. in 2021 and burns money along the way. However we aren't gay bears and therefore don't give a shit and only look at the numbers that confirm or confirmation bias. On a more serious note though, Play Magnus is rapidly expanding and if the successfully tap into the market and can keep their growth rates up, it will lead us close to the sun, forget about the moon.

They also launched quiet some tournament series and sponsor popular chess events and thus increasing the brand awarness. Let's end this with two more screenshots indicating the massive market that might be unleashed.

Shits going down tomorrow. Whether you think it will or not. I made this post 4 days ago and got flamed. So I will post this again. Tomorrow will be the best time you have right now to pull investments. 

Millions will march on DC. Nobody in the market with a sane brain will think ""Oh I better take big positions!""   


People will only pull out money. Hopefully its a 1 day dip. But you dont know how far this goes. Best case scenario, you pull money and get to buy in at a discount.

Worst case scenario, you pay a few fees. 

Thank me later.

I’m no financial expert; I’m a retard like you all who sold his Etsy $80c 01/21 because I went to war with admins but I had a baby to feed and gains to take. 

What comes next is a panic sell by institutions who hitched their horses to Drumpf and Family, hoping for another four years of ratfucking Americans while you celebrate gains based on lower taxes, and lower accountabilities. But like cancer, like tumors, better to cut it early than have it hit way too late.

The markets, in my humble opinion, will drop. It will be blood for option holders in weeklies and monthlies. But... with loss, comes gains. When theta thoroughly ravages you,  as markets stay flat initially, you’ll clutch your pearls as your abusive redneck father confirms why he beats your ass and your mom’s. “You dun voted socialism you idiot!”, he decried while you slowly observe the crash suddenly not going low enough to fail America. Funds get readjusted and paper hands in weeklies sell their promise of 100 shares for way lower than the premium should be.

Suddenly, Biden makes the country return to stable growth. See: Chad Clinton and the blowjob of the decade. Reducing the national debt, stimulating growth. Hurr durr Obama, he had Bitch McConnell killing bulls and bills left, right, and center barely after Sir Former President Mr. Obama took office.

Now we observe a market afraid of higher taxes. Guarantee, they will make it look rosy but once Biden is in, an arbitrary date I’m sure the market will smack down to help the Republicucks legitimize their loss. The rich will be mad, the poor actually use Robinhood and other commission free options apps to fuck their day up, and the recovery comes slow.

Lion is a super legit company. Confirmed!!!
So much potential, read up on it here. This was before amazon ordered 2000 vehicles!
https://pages.thelionelectric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investor-Presentation_20203011.pdf (notice how JT even visited?)

So basically NGA is a SPAC for Lion to get funding for operations. Theyre saying the merger is happening as soon as feb. The only issue here is that once they merge, Lion shareholders will own 70% of the combined company (IF they end up merging which is statistically improbable but COULD always happen if it gets rejected). SPACs are usually a nono but this ones got a lot going for it.

What this means post-merger : assuming todays after hours close at 23$ per share, this implies a 4.5 Billion dollar valuation. Which isn't much in the EV sector... that's why its a BUY NOW until merger ASSUMING you believe in the EV sector. If you don't, ignore this post. 

When I say ""not much for the EV sector"" I'm referencing my opinion to NKLA, which isn't even a real company and has 0 product which is valued at 6+ billion usd right now...

What's happening : not many shares are available pre-merger and I doubt the insiders who own 70% of the ""unavailable shares"" will sell a big part once they can due to the potential of this. It's getting a lot of hype. Possible investigation into this but everything gets investigated these days while no fraud is found.

It's been about 5 months of GameStop continually rising, and from those skinny orange lines the short position has not decreased at all. During this time, GME bulls have been blessed with a sleuth of positive news. Before we start cookin let me get all the ingredients into the pot for you guys:

# Tendie Recipe

[Provided to you by GME shorts](https://preview.redd.it/sg8apugjsm961.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17bb70cb3f0a0c5c4bf91e8505e7655177ef15c5)

# Ingredients

1 **DIGITAL** revenue sharing agreement with GameStop  [(certified fresh by Domo Capital Management)](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/microsoft-will-give-gamestop-a-share-of-xboxs-digital-revenues/)

Xbox Game Pass subscriptions to taste [(15 million subs at $9.99 / month as of Sep 2020)](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449219/xbox-game-pass-15-million-subscribers-microsoft-growth).

1 acquisition of one of largest private game developers in the world for $7.5 billion dollars  [(responsible for elder scrolls, fallout, doom...)](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/21/welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/)

# Cooking Instructions

You have to have a chef's vision to see all this come together - the goal is to stew enough Game Pass subscriptions to make more and more tendies later on. How do we stew more Game pass subs?

* Bullets below - More Game Pass subs = 🚀🚀🚀
   * Take the acquisition above and put some of their best games on Game Pass letting anyone on the subscription play it on Console or on PC.  Steam is on PC, and developers are starting to protest them.  Sony doesn't have a gaming subscription for cross PC-Console play. The digital future will have one master race there will be no console or PC - only game.
   * Partner with the only worldwide gaming focused retailer so they can push your products over competitors.  Sony has a bigger market share globally right now, but with GameStop, Microsoft sees its partner in crime.

&amp;#x200B;

[ 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 ](https://preview.redd.it/jxf6csxg1n961.jpg?width=506&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49e265425dd12fb93f6b55c0b39ea59b6cf7992f)

Above you see how much money Microsoft can make ANNUALLY if they get more subscriptions.  Now back to the whole point of this, we need the last ingredient, that spicy Microsoft deal with GameStop.

GameStop get's a cut of Microsoft's digital Xbox revenue. Here is a quote from the article I linked above:

*""Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba confirmed that same basic outline to Ars Technica based on his conversations with GameStop management. ""The way it's going to work is for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well.""* 

How much of a cut? No one really knows. After July I'll pay one of you paper hands to find out because you're most likely better at that then making this tendie recipe.  Let's speculate though assuming GameStop collects 3% of the revenues.

50 million annual subscriptions = Additional $6 billion in ANNUAL revs for Microsoft

Let's say that GameStop, because they're chummy with Microsoft, sell about 35% of ongoing XBOXs moving forward, allowing them to access the digital revenue share.

This works out to be additional $63 million dollars at almost 100% margins. And this is just from **subscriptions alone**.  How much are the rest of the DLC, microtransactions, and full digital game downloads worth for GameStop?  It's hard to know because Microsoft doesn't release detailed stats.  But let's take a look at their competitor so we can extrapolate.

1609907453,32,0,FALSE,1609907464,1,"Memes are hilarious, love that shit, but there was a time when WSB had stories like this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Before 1776, you didn’t need to know math and shit to understand economics. Because back then, if a country was 1/3 of the world’s population (like India in year 1 AD), it was 1/3 of the global economy.  And if a country had 1/4 of the world’s population (like China at the time), it was 1/4 of the global economy. Because before tractors and electricity and shit were invented during the industrial revolution, which was in full swing by 1776, a motherfucker could only hunt or gather or grow so much shit on any given plot of land. If a country ran out of land, it ran out of food, and its people starved, which kept both population and economic growth in check. And that explains all that old world raping and pillaging and conquering of land, because up to that point, economic growth meant one thing, more land.  
&gt;  
&gt;But after the industrial revolution, a motherfucker could grow or produce a shit-ton more on any given plot of land, which meant if you could out-think and out-machine the other guy, you could make legit fuck-you cash money without a crown or an army, which was some new shit at the time. And to explain all this, in 1776 Adam Smith wrote a book called An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations and invented economics. And thank god for that, because for roughly 300,000 years before Smiths book, people believed that successful crops and hunts and shit was the work of the gods. What Smith taught us is that economic production in the post-industrial era is not the work of god, but instead the the work of invisible hands. And this changed everything.  
&gt;  
&gt;It just so happened that the same year Smith invented economics, the United States of America was invented, a frontier refuge for wild-eyed fortune seekers and reject religious mystics, and in America all that new money magic found one fuck of a home. And for the next hundred years or so, Americans went ape shit building their country while experimenting with all this new money magic, hustling and slaughtering their way across the Wild West to the Pacific Ocean leaving a trail of over 1000 banks and more than 8000 different paper currencies.  
&gt;  
&gt;But by 1849, with no more land to settle, everyone realized that the US paper money situation was out of control and what the world really needed was some kinda universal non-bullshit currency everyone could agree on. And fuck, it just so happened gold was discovered in California that year, and thats some shiny-ass universal cash-money bling everyone could agree on.  
&gt;  
&gt;So for the next hundred years, as the rest of the old world warred themselves broke killing each other over land all old school like, America built new and improved machines and hoarded gold until finally, by the end of WWII, America totally owned that shit and became the pimp daddy boss-man of global money. I mean, America had most of the worlds gold which meant America had all the money in the world. So to seal the deal, in 1944 the US invited all those broke-ass bitch money countries to a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire and explained how global money shit was gonna work moving forward: the US would own and manage the worlds gold supply and set the price of gold and peg the US dollar to gold which they alone would exclusively control. Meanwhile everyone else would peg their bitch-ass money to the dollar. Or they were commies, in which case, they still had to peg their money to dollars if they wanted to buy the shit they needed from the west, but only after converting it at shitty exchange rates on the black market. And the rest of the world, seeing how their paper shit compared to all that US gold, they were like, cool.  
&gt;  
&gt;With all the worlds money newly interconnected and global, shit got really fucking complicated. Thankfully, to explain it all, in 1934 a dude named John Maynard Keynes wrote the The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money and invented macro economics, which, compared to Adam Smith, was like the New Testament of money: same God, different rules.  
&gt;  
&gt;Or maybe exactly like that. I mean, what does it say on the US dollar. It says “in God we trust”. Fuck, the US constitution doesn’t even say that. This was some holy fucking shit they were dealing with and they knew it. So taking a page from Ancient Rome, in 1913 the US Congress built 13 stone columned temples across the land to house a select group of non-elected financial holy men to guide the magic hands. This was called The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States of America, and to this day, that’s where we go to pray when money shit gets really fucked up in the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the decades that followed WWII, shit was pretty good in the USA and Americans spent like fat-ass type-2 diabetic SSRI-happy sun-burnt Florida Lottery winners. Which was fucking great for a while, but by the early 1970’s, the debt started to pile up. And well, everyone knows the 70’s was a total shit decade in American history. In fact, by the early 70’s, the country was a fucking mess, unemployment was 6.1%, and inflation (some old-school economic shit you can Google), was 6.2%. Which would suck for any US President to deal with, especially in an election year. Because dealing with a troubled economy requires leadership and sacrifice, which is a hard sell to American voters in the best of times and imfuckingpossible for a dude like Richard Milhous Nixon. So after months of praying to the Fed for a re-election miracle, Nixon had an idea. Well, it wasn’t really his idea, it was something his 42 year-old Undersecretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs, a guy by the name of Paul Volcker, had been pitching for a while. Basically, Volcker realized that the US was the pimp-daddy of all the worlds money, which meant US money was the only game in town, which meant the US treasury could wipe their ass with newly printed dollars and the world would still pimp their sisters to get their dirty little war-torn broke-ass fingers on the shit. So fuck, why back the money with gold? That shit was just a whole lotta extra work, what with all that settling of account balances and interest rates and shit. Fuck that.  
&gt;  
&gt;You get the point, and so did Nixon. He was a fucking hustler at heart plus he was the fucking President of the United States and if Volcker was right, de-pegging the dollar to gold would mean he could manipulate the fuck out of the invisible hands. Like printing billions or paper dollars to distribute to smart-money Wall Street campaign donors to “invest” in stocks and jack up asset prices putting a few imaginary paper dollars in the pockets of struggling main-Street dumb money investor-voters, or debase the value of US money just enough to drive down prices of shit-rate US exports to win back market share from Germany and Japan.  
&gt;  
&gt;But just one problem, Fed Chair Arthur Burns who was like, wait, what?  
&gt;  
&gt;Ok, so here’s the thing, Nixon was a fucking sleazeball who would give zero fucks to just bulldozing those sanctimonious unelected Fed motherfuckers. But 1973 was an election year and he needed a story to trash a century old global economic order. I mean, what he really needed was an enemy, some fucking non-English speaking Illuminati motherfucker lurking in the shadows and threatening American jobs, because Americans eat that shit up. So in August 1971, Nixon took to prime time television and announced to an Aaron Spelling-loving TV-dinner-eating Vietnam-weary America that “International money speculators” were destroying the value of he dollar and costing American jobs. Which may seem like some obvious fucking ludicrous-mode political bullshit, but in the early 70s, shit was legit hard economically for a lot of Americans. And politicians understand that shit because at that level, when you get to be president, rule number one is that when shit is both mysterious and fucked up, never try and explain it - leave that shit to the losing party - instead find a villain and tell your people how you’re gonna fuck that motherfucker up. That pretty much always works. Because the universe is as much a fucking mystery today as it has been for over 300,000 years, a complex system that our pleasure-seeking, story-telling monkey brains are not wired to understand. Unemployment? Inflation? Fuck, we still can’t explain that shit. We are wired to survive in the wilderness and we know a threat when we see it, which is some primal brain hard-coded survival shit, like a rustle in the bush beyond the light of the campfire, it gets our hearts beating and bonds us as a tribe behind the dude with the biggest club. Until he gets eaten by fucking bears. But whatever, in the moment we’ll believe whatever he fuck he says. And what Nixon said was that we can’t trust money to both gold and god. We had to chose. So he de-coupled the dollar from gold and henceforth, and to this day, money became faith.  
&gt;  
&gt;The day after the Nixon announcement, the Dow rose 33 points, its biggest daily gain ever at that point. A New York Times editorial read, ""We unhesitatingly applaud the boldness with which the President has moved."" Which may have been “bold” and all, but it was also a fucking disaster. In the two years that followed, gold rose nearly 300%, from 43 to over 120, and the US suffered three quarters of negative GDP growth while unemployment exceeded 9% and inflation nearly doubled, hovering in the range of 10-12%, prompting global currencies to go all ape-shit searching for some semblance of fair market value in the hunger-games free for all that was the post gold global economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;But fuck, that was one fuck of a good time to be trading currencies. Which brings us, fuck finally, to the trade...  
&gt;  
&gt;A few years later, Andy Krieger was a graduate student in South Asian philosophy and a competitive athlete at Penn, committed to making the world a better place.  Aw. But one morning, after a long night translating some obscure Sanskrit text, he got to thinking: academia is a fucking slog, the kind of job where you had to wait for some old bearded wizard to die to get ahead. So the next day he met with his dissertation advisor and announced that he was gonna drop out of the graduate program and enroll at Wharton to translate the ancient mysteries of money. And with the world just starting to make sense of all the newly floated currencies and all kinds of crazy new financial instruments like options, Krieger was instantly hooked.  
&gt;  
&gt;This was 1984, and few traders know what a currency option was, let alone how to price one. Black Sholes was a new-new thing and computers were non-existent.  But Krieger saw the potential of all this shit and knew he could use these instruments in a very powerful way so while still a student, he joined a  Chicago options trading firm and learned the ropes and after returning to Wharton, he wrote a computer program to price options that relied on assumptions no one else was thinking about at the time. This got him noticed by Solomon Brothers and then Bankers Trust.  And there, after a run of hugely profitable trades no one really understood, in 1987, the CEO of Bankers Trust gave him $700m to trade.  And fuck me, with option leverage, this meant next-level shit tons of billions.  
&gt;  
&gt;On October 19th, 1987, on what became known as Black Monday, the DJIA fell 22.6%, the largest single day percentage drop in history.  But Krieger was cool.  He watched the world dump dollars and flood into alternative currencies, many of which were small and tied to struggling economies.  But Krieger knew this was a panic flight to anywhere but the Wall Street carnage. He also knew that as soon as the markets settled, the fast money would head right back to the safety of the dollar and their currencies would revert.  So with $700m and 400:1 leverage, Krieger placed his bets, the largest of which was a short against the New Zealand dollar (the Kiwi), eventually taking a position greater than the entire New Zealand monetary supply. And fuck, at the same time, Krieger had complex positions in the British Pound and the German Mark and even another short in the USD.  At any given time, Krieger had over $40B in trades in float fluctuating over $20m in value at any given time.  
&gt;  
&gt;And then, with markets swinging wildly, as the Kiwi drops just 5% against the dollar, Krieger exits everything for a profit of $300m. Fuck.  
&gt;  
&gt;After exiting the trade, with Wall Street a walking-dead financial dystopia, Krieger quit the game completely and retired to some island in the Caribbean. In the aftermath, regulators started to poke around at the one bank who booked a profit, based entirely on Krieger’s trading while Wall Street melted and an accounting scandal ensued involving Arthur Anderson, the auditor of Bankers Trust, which you could literally cut and past into the post-Enron economy of 2001. Meanwhile, the New Zealand government was crying foul publicly while privately counting their Kiwi blessings that Krieger had successfully tanked their money making NZ exports competitive on the global market. At the time it was a total money shit show, as quaint as that may seem today.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the years that followed, Soros did the same kind of shit and made $1B breaking the Bank of England and then a shit-ton more shorting the Thai Baht. And there were other cool-ass macro money mega trades but by the late 90s, all that shit came to an end as the central banks came to realize what the politicians had long known: when some threat creeps in from the economic wilderness and shit gets crazy and mysterious, our monkey brains turn to the dudes with the biggest club. And central banks have the big clubs. Until they get eaten by bears. But so far, that hasn’t happened.

Unfortunately, my love and what very little money I can come across does not belong to inflating a company that has robbed people for so long.

This all said, I am here to share with you the only major hunch and play I got left; Nokia. I feel like it is severely undervalued, and for what it's worth, this is a chart-specific play...

\-Moving average and candlestick analysis-

7/16/2012, Nokia bottoms out at $1.63.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img q7xnyyeswm961...*

9/15/2014, a bullish correction/impulse tops out at $8.73.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

10/14/2013, Nokia broke above the red 200 MA, and on 8/24/2015 had a successful retest of it for support.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 88ray7itwm961...*

Between 02/08/2016 and 04/18/2016, Nokia fought to stay above the red 200w MA.

On the week of 04/18/2016, Nokia produced a bearish doji candle at the red 200w MA and finally succumbed to large sell volume from gay bears confirming it as resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vawm55ouwm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f887e9f69e05c193357ff0e0585a60dee3fc1cc5

Since that candle, the price of Nokia has fluctuated in a large, 2,009 day range between a high of $6.65 and a low of $2.34.

The 200w MA has been tested and rejected 6 times, with the most recent occurrence being on the trading week of 08/03/2020.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Fibonnaci analysis-

Nokia has stair-stepped down from one Fib to the next ever since confirming the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement as resistance on the week of 01/25/2016.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o6dbdwivwm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91bc2178b0c8d05b56705413ae1901dc2b01517c

&amp;#x200B;

Nokia then struggled from 02/01/2016 to 07/22/2019 for 1,267 days with breaking and staying above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement. The 0.382 retracement during this time frame was also roughly the same area the red 200w MA resided, which provided confluence for the gay bears.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j9xzweewwm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45f488b30cf0f9d122c775298800ea52b84e3cda

11/14/2016, Nokia very briefly broke below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and was very rapidly brought back up to test the red 200w MA. This major test of resistance was, yet again, a failure. From this moment forward Nokia was only able to genuinely break above the red 200w MA one time, 01/07/2019. After ranging above it for only a few short months, Nokia broke below and a subsequent retest caused a massive 42.29% drop in less than 4 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/etvy6bvwwm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e6f46a8038b393789966aa751c2d4bfa39145da

For approximately 3 months afterwards, Nokia attempted to regain upward traction. It was rejected immediately as soon as it hit the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, causing yet another major 48.34% selloff from Covid fears. This selloff yielded a low of $2.34, the lowest share price it has had in approximately 2,750 days. On the week of 07/27/2020, Nokia was able to again very briefly break above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. After producing a low volume bull flag below the 200w MA, it was rejected to a low of $3.21. Since the Covid price of  $2.34, $3.21 has so far been the next higher low for Nokia and has since produced another fairly low volume bull flag.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z1lrfnj1xm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1854900a6c47ecb596d43eaf8643da4d8cc595cd

&amp;#x200B;

For the retards like myself who can't maff very well, 2,750 days comes out to 7.53 years. During Covid, Nokia hit a fucking low that it has not seen in over SEVEN POINT FIVE YEARS. SEVEN POINT FIVE YEARS.

&amp;#x200B;

\-RSI analysis-

This is where shit gets fucking \*interesting\*.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vwh8jmx1xm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a60db103050a04f08ff4ed4bb5773714a3e8f931

This is the weekly timeframe.

Notice the trendline. On 9 different occasions, Nokia has attempted to break above it only to be rejected and fail support tests.

On the 10th occasion, Nokia was able to have a minor breakout, successfully retest the trendline, and have a significant rise thereafter.

The 10th occasion has so far been the longest Nokia has been able to stay above this trendline, with 2 major successful tests of support.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1d2l1wc2xm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=583631d853cc314794e4524fbe1979b9905d5d33

It is now battling with the bullish 50 RSI area for the 3rd time. Each of two prior tests of 50 RSI also coincided with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. That means this is a major zone.

After breaking back below the 0.618, the RSI trendline was successfully tested for support. It then bearfagged back up to the 0.618, only to nosedive on a high volume dump.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img hx7jsnp2xm961...*

This is the 2 week RSI.

Notice how on 3 separate occasions, 60 RSI has so far been rejected. The first two occasions were roughly the same price point, while the third occasion was with a significantly lower high.

This shows hidden bearish divergence, which was likely a major reason for the price to have dumped so hard from its local high. One thing I have learned about hidden bearish divergence is that it is often an early indicator of buyer strength. It pretty much always results in a retracement, but thereafter, a fairly large rise. This occasion is so far clearly no different.

Notice also that there is significant bullish divergence in the RSI.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d5utlt63xm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500b6016b6dd1b8524e851ebd150168dac68bf67

&amp;#x200B;

This is the 2 month RSI.

&amp;#x200B;

50 RSI is getting hardcore rejected every time price causes the RSI to go anywhere near it. This is a strong indicator in my experience of accumulation.

The moment 50 RSI breaks on the 2 month RSI and there will likely be a very, very parabolic amount of buying support.

&amp;#x200B;

My second favorite of this TA: the 3 month RSI.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i2z7gn04xm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71b056135b91044375d9f96ea8b502a230d4ec0a

40 RSI absolutely refuses to break, but hey, it has on a few different occasions. Notice the reactions in price however whenever 40 RSI breaks.

Price moons.

After a bullish engulfing candle starting 04/01/2020, 2 subsequent 3 month candles have so far been rejected at entering below 40 RSI, one of which having a very long tail and closing as a long legged doji. This is another strong indicator of reversal aka buying support. They also coincide with the 0.786 and near perfect closes below the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement.

Someone is accumulating.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Patterns-

And now, my favorite part of this TA.

Have you been wondering what the big ass white line is for in some of my screenshots, or do you already know? They say when something is too good to be true, it almost always is. I won't ever give up hope that it isn't, however.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tm5z6lf4xm961.png?width=2308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4451933afe22fdd8e8874ea3350f9c3c92dac3b

&amp;#x200B;

There are 2 white lines in this screenshot. Both are what I believe \*could be\* inverted head and shoulders patterns. If either one of them completes, they can very very easily jump start the next rise in this asset.

If the small one completes, the target for it will be the 7th time contending with the 200w MA residing currently at $5.07.

If both of them complete, Nokia has a minimum price target of roughly $9. IF however the $9 target is met, it will have over doubled the current price for this stock. That \*will\* cause FOMO.

I will admit, I've had not the greatest luck in spotting real inverted head and shoulders patterns. They let me down alot. :()

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, 1/20/22 leaps are currently at $13/$14 a piece right now on Robinhood.

If you pay $14 for a 12 month leap contract, you're essentially 'betting' $1.1666 per month that Nokia will make you money.

I find it incredibly difficult to believe you won't make at least SOME money on this play.

Especially considering months ago, this particular contract bottomed out at $0.12. It just did it again. Double bottom?

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize ahead of time if anything seems off, I have checked and double checked this TA to make sure screenshots are accurate, etc..but I'm far from perfect. I guarantee you I fucked something up.

anyway, buy Nokia while you're waiting on GME or PLTR or NIO or whatever. Think deep in your thoughts what constitutes a *real* meme stock and **NOKIA?** ...

1609904528,35,0,FALSE,1609904538,1,"It seems that unless your a pro, trading options can put you at huge disadvantage vs trading futures, assuming the leverage is not needed, for example on a call spread capital risked is higher than the potential reward, on futures you can set a stop loss to have the same risk but upside and time is not limited. The only possible advantage for options is there's no stop loss to trigger if the stock fall before it goes back up but this advantage would be offset by futures not limiting profits on a price swing the other way. So it looks like with stocks and futures probability of profit/loss is more constant and fixed to near 50/50 with the chances of market move up or down, but with options probability of loss can be much higher than profit depending on how well you know how to trade options. is this correct?

Another point, some people say not to put stop loss on options which makes sense because the option  is already risk limited and you would lose the no stop trigger advantage but very few people would wait for profits equal to 100% so your always risking more than profit target, not many people trading futures would set a stop loss greater then their profit target.

1609898700,231,0,FALSE,1609898710,1,"GME GANGGGG!!! Most of you know I've been long GameStop since 2017, initially. I am an OG GME bull and yearn for our true value to be recognized by the market. RC Ventures sees it. Many others (Senvest, Michael Burry, Hedgeye, etc.) do as well. 

But Melvin Capital does not. They wish we would file for bankruptcy so they can just escape this trade. Alas, they didn't close when the price was $2.57. Greed will be their downfall. But, they are smart. They see the data and for that reason I must enlighten you all about what I am seeing in the data, too. Remember though, one quarter doesn't make or break this thesis. 

GameStop 4Q results will be weak, barring a spontaneous console creation event. Holiday results will be weak. The reality is while the future may be brighter than the wasteland the Melvin perceives for GME, the present isn't so great being at your core primarily a B&amp;M retailer. It doesn't matter how in demand your products are if supply isn't there. I placed more notes in the image.

The reality is the order rate had been excellent earlier in the quarter and had been tapering for some time, spiking when resupply events occurred. I had trimmed my estimates previously, but given the continued slowing of the order rate (\~62k/day to start January) and viewing some US CC data that reflects a slowing sales performance as the quarter went on, it is my duty to share my belief that the forthcoming Holiday results will not be that strong. As I noted in my last post, there was also embedded console resupply included in my January base case, I have removed that assumption, too. 

But let's not get too upset, fellow retards. While Melvin and its army of bankruptcy believers will spew forth vitriol claiming how weak sales prove nO oNe ShOpS aT gAmEsToP, the truth is they know what is coming from RC Ventures and will look to use any entrance of retail shorts into the trade as a means of  supply purchasing their shares from to cover some. The price may retrace if this proves true, however the reality is RC Ventures has bought at $16, and will likely deem a price under the 50 day MA as an excellent buying opportunity especially if they clearly communicate to the market that the reason for the price appreciation is Ryan Cohen, not George Sherman. 

Look, it's a chess match, take the DD aside and think about it. Management reported 3Q and shares tanked. Ryan Cohen bought, and can be seen by observers as the primary catalyst for the upside move. Now, management will report Holiday Sales (and whatever else they have in mind at ICR \[I view a strategic partnership or a smallish technology oriented M&amp;A play as my base case\]) and the price will likely dip next week. Do you believe Ryan Cohen won't take the opportunity to ramp his position up another 2% to 14.9% if the price dips below $15? He will file on Form 4 within two business days and show himself to be the savior, once again. I am speculating, but given the clear preference of WSB, Twitter, and StockTwits for #WeWantCohen its safe to say that retail is on his side. He will likely gather more votes under his own power and from those in alignment with his viewpoint. A forthcoming board slate would be publicized in early March. This is a war, always has been. 

Play tactically if you wish, or 💎 ✋. I would advise against FD buying (in almost all cases, but especially this time). Here's the model.

I'd rather tell it like it is (as the data informs me) rather than put out BS. Hopefully I'm overly conservative. Call me 🌈 🐻 if you must, but I'll own GME longer than 99% of you. Still have a price target of \~$100 by 2023. Cheers

Sup fellow losers!

This is my first ever ""solo"" post. The pun will explain itself here shortly. I also think no one will read this unless I give a shoutout to my primary holdings, $GME. Like many of you, I have a rather large position in GME, but I have size available to trade other tickers as well, so feel free to click away if you got trapped thinking this was a GME post.

So, here is some DD on the EV play $SOLO...

First, I am from Texas, so I dive into an ""eco-friendly"" Chevy 1500 even though I live in the heart of Downtown Houston and would never own an EV car that looks like SOLO's. Although, I am fully aware that my view is not what America and environment-friendly people like. That's fine. I plan on making money from your stupid looking cars. TAKE A LOOK AT THESE TRIPOD SOLO CARS, then come back to me. I guess people still drive Kia's after the hamster commercials and Fiat's, so who knows... 

So the cool thing about this company is that the cars are only $20k, which is a good market for the broke Starbuck environment hippie employee who lives in a $2,000 a month apt in the city cause that is where the action is. This is a great price point for even the commuters into the city because it's a cheap car that they can drive only to work and back. 

Ride Share. I am not sure about everyone here, but my wife loves riding the damn bird scooters, especially when she is drunk. Well, SOLO is trying to create the same thing with their vehicles. Pick up a small tripod and drive them around the city, then drop them off (OBVIOUSLY NOT IF YOU HAVE BEEN DRINKING!!!). This is perfect for people who have to pay to park in the city and instead not move their cars. You bet your sweet titties. Even I would drive one of these tripods around to see people laugh at me.  

Tax Credit. Again, I am from Texas (if you ever met anyone from Texas, you will know because you will tell you 100 times), so I don't have state income tax, but hippies from the west coast could use all the tax breaks they can get. You can get a tax credit from owning an EV car. Well, 20k is a lot better than the price of a Tesla... again, I understand these cars don't look like Tesla's. But a wise man once told me, I am not gay, but $20 is $20. 

Current Retail Footprint.  All in the west coast.... I WONDER WHY???

1. San Diego, CA
2. Brea, CA
3. Scottsdale, AZ — Kierland Commons and Westfield Fashion Square
4. Glendale, AZ
5. Santa Clara, CA
6. Walnut Creek, CA
7. Century City, CA
8. Sherman Oaks, CA
9. Portland, OR

Manufacturing. SOLO is a Canadian company but is expected to announce a new site in the US for manufacturing. Right now, they only have manufacturing in China. This is great news because now they don't have to pay import/export prices from China anymore. They have narrowed the search down to two sites, Arizona and Tennessee. After all, who knows what will happen with whoever our president is coming next month.  

Chart Technical. Based on the below, we're currently while writing this at $6.57. I think we could hit a new high of $15 with a small short squeeze. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL!!!!

* Float: 24M
* 52 High: $13.60
* Short %: 12.23%
* Market Cap: 422.26M
* EPS: -0.28

SOLO is Presenting at the 23rd Annual Needham Growth Conference on January 12, 2021. So join in to hear more. This ticker is being picked up on numerous articles, some good, some bad. This is just my DD cause I never see anything on here about SOLO. 

TLDR: STAY WOKE ON SOLO.

Basically, it seems like there is a ton of naked short selling going on and no one is doing anything about it. Thus, I propose a complaint campaign to get someone (cough, perhaps a government body who was designed to look into shit just like this, cough) to do something. 

We can submit complaints here:

 [https://www.sec.gov/tcr](https://www.sec.gov/tcr) 

There is literally an exact category for this (""Manipulation of a Security"" and then select ""Abusive Naked Short Selling""). 

I'm a simpleton autist, I don't get fancy with my words but I've drafted a basic letter here that you can use:

*To whom it may concern,*

*This letter serves to bring the SEC’s attention to suspected illegal activity in GameStop Corporation’s (ticker GME) trading. As a shareholder in GME, I have concerns about illegal naked short selling and increasing failure-to-deliver rates in the month of December 2020 through present day. GME has consistently appeared on the NYSE Threshold Security list for the last 18 trading days. In order to appear on the threshold list, a stock has to have 0.05% of outstanding shares fail-to-deliver, for GameStop this amounts to roughly 350,000 shares.* ***GME’s failure to-delivery rates have exceed this amount on most trading days in December 2020****.* ***Furthermore, on at least three trading days in December,*** ***the total number of shares failed-to-deliver exceeded 1 million****. Below is a summary of trading days in December which had exceptionally high failures-to-deliver:*

*12/1: 91,971 @ $16.56*

*12/2: 1,061,397 @ $15.80*

*12/3: 1,787,191 @ $16.58*

*12/4: 999,475 @ $16.12*

*12/7: 1,002,379 @ $16.90*

*12/8: 872,292 @ $16.35*

*12/9: 721,361 @ $16.94*

*12/10: 605,975 @ $13.66*

*12/11: 880,063 @ $14.12*

*12/14: 284,296 @ $13.31*

*Given the data presented above, I request the SEC to further investigate suspected illegal naked short-selling in GME, particularly as it concerns Melvin Capital, who holds a substantial short position in the Company.*

Now as an autist, I don't even know if I've fully got the concept down but I think I'm close enough. Would love feedback if anyone with a big brain has any.

DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.

The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.

* The Chinese ADR/ADS sector gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng

* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping, NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89. MU reports earnings this Thursday after market close.

* The GA run-off election is on the market mindset as voters are heading to the polls. Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.

1609879378,55,0,FALSE,1609879389,1,"My fellow peeps,

This is an old strategy but it’s hot right now so I figure I’d share some low delta finds to consider for those looking to be millionaires in a year or two:

$BB 1/21/22 15c @ ~0.2 Delta : I’d buy this if you feel they can edge their way into EV computer systems and automated driving

$AAPL 1/21/22 250c @ ~0.08 Delta : I firmly believe that come summer with Foxconn’s new partnership we should see EV vehicle concepts being advertised that should boost the price and print those tendies

$PLTR 1/21/22 45c @ ~0.4 Delta : a little higher but still fairly low for being so far out but of course the price target is also high. Lots of PLTR cucks on WSB right now plus they do have the potential to take the lead on EV automated driving systems

Feel free to bash my choices and share with fellow autists your LEAPS plays.

TLDR : LEAPS are essentially low delta plays (anything below .5 is good) that are more than 3 months out though also usually ITM but on speculation can include OTM",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr7b1t/type_leaps_for_cheats/,,1/5/2021,20:42:58,3:42:58 PM,15:42:58

[Well, ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kjhkkv/back_at_it_again_with_progressive_pgr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) I got an unfortunate entry at 1.5 for my Feb 19th calls. Not sure who expected Monday to be one of the worst year openings since 92 but it wasn’t me. On a slow moving stock like Progressive that could be a killer. But I’m still in.

https://ibb.co/cwdpfZf

I plan to average down from my pathetic 1.4 entry after the monster dividend releases with another 4 100c at whatever open mid is after the dividend comes in. If you want a piece of that $4.5 a share, you should get in before close on 1/7 - I had enough leftover cash to get 10 shares.

Note before y’all yolo and lose all your money: This is no longer a slam dunk because of Monday’s clappening but I still think there’s significant upside and why I urged you all to get Feb calls instead of Jan in case this went against us (it did). 97.5c is almost guaranteed but 100 is still on the table.

Current Price: $96.67

Target Price: $102. 

I think they are gonna smash earnings for every reason from the last post with the added confidence a company that releases a near 5% dividend gives in a global pandemic. I think the work-from-home experiment is going to fizzle up slightly, and we are gonna see more people go back to actual work in the coming months, with the headway mostly made in the latter half of 2020. This, mixed in with a solidified political system, should give the market some confidence to do its thing. 

Last year at this time progressive climbed 10% from this time in Jan to Feb 19th. The last two dividends that came out saw the stock climb ~4% and ~6% respectively. If history repeats itself, combined with a good earnings call, we should be able to see a low end of 98 and a high end of ~106 on 2/19. 

According to the WSJ there are 7 buy ratings, 10 holds and 2 sells. The price target average is $100.13 with a low of $87 and a high of $125. 

The volume average yesterday was a million more than normal (2.49m up from 1.44m)

I'm gonna give it to you very simply because I know not all of us are geniuses like me. You see there's a company called Lemonade and they do mostly some shit that nobody cares about. But something that all you retards do care about is money $$$$$. THE BIG DOLLAR BILLS IS WHAT YOU WANT AND ITS WHAT YOULL GET.

So listen up, the stock will go up, then it will go down, then it will go back up again. Let me explain to you autists my genius reasoning behind this. Because the earth is flat, it's summer right now in French, and do you know what the French like to drink in summer???? THATS RIGHT. LEMONADE. 

And why should we trust you, well my friend, I have watched this stock for a total of 3, yes THREE days. Every day, the stock has moved either up or down, BY CRAZY AMOUNTS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS OFFICIAL LOOKING PICTURE FROM A WEBSITE I FOUND OFF GOOGLE.

*Processing img 9u48u7mppk961...*

As you can see, the stock went up 8% today!!! Wow! This is crazy! And incredible! I'm ready to sell my kidney to purchase stock options for this stock! To add more proof, the ""experts"" at this website believe that the stock is overvalued. That is just completely preposterous and incorrect! They said the same thing about $TSLA when it just split! And now it is worth way more. 

In conclusion, all signs are pointing to $LMND going to the moon! Join me next week as I will explain to you why my next stock pick (it's a secret) IS GOING TO GO UP 1200% IN THE NEXT YEAR.

This is for fully paid lending programs like Fidelity has ( they require $250,000 min account but some brokerages require less and some don’t offer the program).

Below is a link I found of hard to borrow stocks. It gives current rates, but if there are other or more complete lists, please provide link.  

The rate Fidelity gives lenders is usually half of what is listed and fluctuates almost daily. 
So if you own the stock it pays a huge interest rate plus any returns.

Wouldn’t it make sense to go through the high interest ones, buy and hold the ones that seem they’d go up?
It seems like an easy way to earn money if you’re buying a lot of stocks anyway, swing trading or long term.
Of course you’d still want to research each stock, and not go off that rate alone.

1609874157,226,0,FALSE,1609874167,1,"Thesis: a buyout of PRSP is imminent. January options are where the UOA is placed at. Price target for buyout: $32-33.

Hey autists long time no see I’ve been here for a while and I see no really quality plays out there so here’s one where it involves some good ol’ fashioned DD, some massive unusual options activity and some massive whales that are in a stock that most of you have never heard about, waiting for a buyout that is imminent by January 15 according to the whales’ calls. 

Perspecta is a boomer version of Palantir that has a backlog of military and government IT contracts. Spun out of DXC technologies, the company is massively undervalued at 23 bucks a share where it is currently trading. PRSP has been a target of merger and acquisition in the past but there have only been rumors until Jana partners (the massive whale) took a heavy position. Now who tf is Jana? 

Jana partners specializes in special-situation strategies (aka they park their money in a company and force them to get bought out). One of their successful plays was none other than Computer Sciences corporation, a company that was merged with HP enterprise to make DXC technologies (you see where I’m going with this? They’ve done this before in the same exact sector with the same exact company that was the parent of Perspecta). 

Now, the timing here is key. You wanna buy FD’s with the maximum likelihood of making it. This is where the unusual options kick in. A massive whale has taken a 5500 call position on the january 22.5 strike. More speculative plays have been placed on the 25 strike at 0.7 avg cost (averaging around 200k in premium total in 3-4 sweeps, by my estimate one person has placed 100k of premium). This stock has next to 0 retail interest so I think these options are bought by more sophisticated traders (less than 1000 watchers on stocktwits). 

To make things more interesting, Perspecta has leaked that they’re in the process of a potential buyout: https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3643457-perspecta-reportedly-hires-goldman-sachs-to-consider-strategic-options-potential-sale-shares. 

That news “leak” was right after insiders loaded 90 million dollars worth of shares at 18.87 average. To top it all off, all of the major funds that are heavily invested in prsp (Point72, DE Shaw, Maverick Capital etc) have added heavily to their stakes in the past quarter. This, along with the UOA on options and the heavy coiling of the chart, points to a January buyout. 

Perspecta is trading at around 8.2 EBITDA, but average company in this sector is trading at 11.5-12. Given the fact that the CEO has said that shares are undervalued at 25 and that these whales have increased their stakes with an average cost of 23 or so per share, we’re looking at a price target of 32-33 for the potential buyout. The 30 FD’s are currently trading at just 0.1, making this a high reward to risk scenario. 

Last but not least, just look at the chart. The amount of coiling resembles all of the buyouts that we’ve seen (such as FLIR as the most recent example). Heavy blocks have been bought everyday at MOC so someone has been building a large stake.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr5ewm/meet_perspecta_prsp_a_boomer_palantir_that_might/,,1/5/2021,19:15:57,2:15:57 PM,14:15:57

**Building a Launch Pad in 2019 - Supply and Demand**

You have all heard demand is up and supply is down, but what the hell does that actually mean for steel stocks?  To clarify a few points, Global Steel demand has remained largely flat through 2020 and is only expected to rise ~4% in 2021.  Supply is, and has always been the issue here; because of this I will largely ignore the increased demand arguments as they will have minimal impact on current prices unless something major changes like a new infrastructure stimulus bill which is very unlikely short term.  When talking about global Steel/Iron ore prices, you are almost always talking about Chinese Supply/demand.  There are other factors that can affect domestic demand/supply in countries (see India), but for the sake of this DD, I will limit the scope to the Asia Pacific.  With that said, let’s begin.

In January of 2019 the  Córrego do Feijão mining complex in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais collapsed, setting the stage for what will now be called the Great Global Steel Shortage of 2021.

*($VALE bois turn away - RIP Jan 2019 calls)*

https://www.canadianminingjournal.com/news/iron-ore-video-shows-exact-moment-when-vales-dam-collapsed/

This disaster not only caused extensive loss of life with more than 240 reported deaths, but it also severely constrained Vale’s iron-ore supply slated for seaborne markets. Authorities ordered a halt in production across many of Vale’s Brazil mines—including at Brucutu, the largest in the Minas Gerais state—output capacity totalling nearly one-quarter of the mining company’s initial 2019 production target of 400 million tonnes was taken offline **(an amount equivalent to around 6 percent of the entire annual global seaborne iron-ore market).** By February, Vale had declared force majeure(unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract) on the sales contracts of several iron-ore qualities, while volatile weather conditions in the north of Brazil also had an adverse impact on the mining company’s iron-ore operations. By the second quarter, Vale’s production levels were a hefty **34 percent lower vis-a-vis second-quarter 2018 levels.** It has also posted two consecutive quarters of losses in 2019, with a $133-million loss for the second quarter (against a $76-million gain in net income recorded for the same quarter in 2018), adding to the whopping $1.6-billion loss Vale notched up in the first quarter.  

Across the ocean in March 2019 Cyclone Veronica decided to stop by Western Australia’s Pilbara Coast and force major local iron-ore mines to shut down production. As a result, prices sailed past the $100-per-tonne mark, before being driven even further skywards during the second quarter after Rio Tinto reported dramatic declines in output. The Australian mining giant’s iron-ore production dropped by 7 percent, to 80 million tonnes, during the second quarter compared to the previous year, as bad weather and operational challenges at their mines continued to weigh heavily on capacity. Rio Tinto also slashed its forecast for 2019 shipments. Fellow mining major BHP, meanwhile, also saw annual output for fiscal 2019 decline by 2 percent to 269.6 million tonnes, again partly stemming from the devastating impacts of Australia’s tropical cyclones.

The two countries represent China’s largest iron-ore suppliers and given the hugely consequential supply problems in Brazil and Australia, China struggled to buy iron ore from the global market as easily as has normally been the case. Data from China’s General Administration of Customs shows that imports declined in June to 75.18 million tonnes, the lowest level since February 2016 and almost 11 percent lower than June 2018 levels. China therefore, tapped its own stockpiles of the commodity to satiate demand from its rampant steel sector. At 115 million tonnes at the end of June 2019, port stockpiles fell to their lowest level in more than two years and were 18 percent lower than 12 months prior. This also meant that only four weeks of inventory supply were on hand for steel producers.  Today those levels are even further diminished to 104.62 tonnes.  S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, for example, calculated that a 54-million-tonne deficit will transpire for the global seaborne iron-ore market in 2019 and **estimates that it could take another three years before the market returns to a state of balance between production and consumption. S&amp;P chiefly holds the Australian and Brazilian supply disruption responsible for this deficit.**  


**Assembling the Ship with Excess Steel - Steel Oversupply, Covid and Destocking**

By March 2020, Chinese steel producers were dealing with soaring finished and semi-finished steel inventories due to a covid infected export market.  Global moves to idle furnaces, and lockdown restrictions were put into effect.  This halt in steel supply put all eyes on China who, short of Feb/March, had been increasing production month over month.  Then something interesting happened, Chinese steel overstocks started to decrease.  By June 2020 those inventories had dissolved, global producers were STILL scaling down furnace production and China for the first time in a decade became a net importer of steel.  Lack of steel inventory, and capped out Chinese production (literally hit an all time production high in October 2020), paired with a global market who had been destocking inventories over the last 2 years, and idled production set sent prices soaring.  A rush to increase production internationally was met with hesitation due to ongoing lockdown concerns, increased ore prices, and lack of global supply iron.  Furnace restarts only started happening in early December.  Hopefully this helps everyone gain an understanding of the current steel situation. The entire supply chain is currently five months behind production, work orders extending out 20 weeks for finished/semi finished steel products, and spot inventories are non-existent.  The idea that we can just ramp up production to fill this gap is met by extreme iron ore shortages.  Recycled scrap has offered temporary relief, but they are also hitting 10 year highs.  Pair all this with a La Niña year in 2021 which will further impact iron supply; it is becoming increasingly apparent that there is no release available for these prices.

Listen, travel restrictions are being lifted internationally, people are getting there second dose of Pfizer, and it’s being proven that the vaccines are effective against this “scary” new strain.

Now, while you all have been cock riding $MT making your 2% gains, you have forgot about a more important part of what a reversion back to preCOVID norms is going to look like.  What do I mean?  It’s simple, as people are flying more, driving more, or building more, most of them are going to consume oil.

But why this index fund you may ask?  Because it’s twice leveraged, and sells options, it couldn’t get more autistic.  Also it was over a thousand pre-corona.

Like I said earlier, now that the boomers realize that the world will start traveling more (although maybe slightly less so) they will be investing in things like Marathon and Murphy oil.  As they do so over the next 2 or 3 months, a retard should be buying calls on this twice leveraged fund.

My advice to buyers: you can tell the days trend in the first 2 minutes after the market opens for GUSH, and the biggest draw back is the low volume for OTM options.  So if you see the stock go up within a minute or two of tomorrow’s open for those who get here late, then it’s probably a good time to buy, but if you see it go down, buy about a half hour before close for a discount.

I've been doing a lot of work in the US cannabis space and 2021 is shaping up to be a big year for the cannabis industry and for Ayr Strategies (AYRWF), a US multi-state operator.

**TL;dr: The stock could be a 3-6x over the next year and 10x+ longer-term. The US MSOs will be the most direct beneficiaries of growing cannabis consumption, and AYRWF has a strong management team, the highest growth over the next two years, best-in-class margin profile, and lowest valuation.**

*Note: the company is listed in Canada under AYR.A and is available over-the-counter under AYRWF (OTC ticker recently changed from AYRSF to AYRWF).*

**Thesis**

* Cannabis is a $80-100Bn consumer staple category but only $20Bn are legal sales. The rest of the market is illicit. In addition to seeing the overall industry grow, the US operators should see a strong tailwind from illicit sales converting to legal sales
* AYRWF is expanding its footprint in seven high-growth states including MA, PA, NJ, AZ, OH, FL, and NV (see table below)
   * Limited license dynamics gives AYRWF a buffer against new competition
   * Recent acquisitions in Florida and New Jersey give the company a strong position in two large, growing markets. Deals slated to close in 1Q21/2Q21
* Strong financial profile
   * AYRWF projected to grow \~140% in 2021 (75% organic) and 65% in 2022 (40% organic)
   * The Company has 40%+ EBITDA margins currently
* Company has a strong, sophisticated management team with a background in finance, mergers &amp; acquisitions, and operations. They run a tight ship as evidenced by their high EBITDA margins and ability to execute through COVID-related disruptions throughout 2020
* Several industry catalysts including:
   * Adult use legalization in PA, FL, OH
   * Banking bill that decriminalizes cannabis. Would improve margin profile, improve cost of debt, and would allow AYRWF to list on a major exchange
      * Banking bill would be a major catalyst for all of the US operators
* Stock is significantly undervalued
   * AYRWF trading at 9.5x and 5.0x 2021 and 2022 EBITDA, respectively vs peer average of 21x 2021 and 13.5x 2022
   * For context, GRWG trading at 40x+ 2022 EBITDA

**What is the stock worth?**

* If AYRWF simply traded at the group average of 13x 2022 EBITDA, the stock would be worth $75, or a 3x from here...
* ...but what would you pay for a high-growth consumer staple business growing 40%+ organically with 40%+ EBITDA margins? 25x EBITDA ($145 target price - 6x upside)? 30x ($170)? 40x ($230 - 9x upside)? I believe the stock will get a higher valuation as we get positive news throughout 2021 and cannabis increasingly becomes a part of the mainstream
* How does the valuation gap close? Deal closures, execution, and discovery. Until recently AYRWF has been a strong but smaller player that not many people had heard of. Through a series of acquisitions (some of which have yet to close) the company will have a diversified footprint indexed to some of the best markets in the US. The company is well positioned to become a top 5 MSO by the end of 2021

**Risks**

* Recently announced deals to acquire assets in FL and NJ don't close
* Delays in implementation of adult use sales in AZ and NJ
* Execution missteps

This leveraged index fund is gonna moon.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀  Why? you may say; it’s simple retards, the boomers are finally starting to realize that COVID is dying.  Listen, travel restrictions are being lifted internationally, people are getting there second dose of Pfizer, and it’s being proven that the vaccines are effective against this “scary” new strain.

Now, while you all have been cock riding $MT making your 2% gains, you have forgot about a more important part of what a reversion back to preCOVID norms is going to look like.  What do I mean?  It’s simple, as people are flying more, driving more, or building more, most of them are going to consume oil.

But why this index fund you may ask?  Because it’s twice leveraged, and sells options, it couldn’t get more autistic.  Also it was over a thousand pre-corona.

Like I said earlier, now that the boomers realize that the world will start traveling more (although maybe slightly less so) they will be investing in things like Marathon and Murphy oil.  As they do so over the next 2 or 3 months, a retard should be buying calls on this twice leveraged fund.

My advice to buyers: you can tell the days trend in the first 2 minutes after the market opens for GUSH, and the biggest draw back is the low volume for OTM options.  So if you see the stock go up within a minute or two of tomorrow’s open for those who get here late, then it’s probably a good time to buy, but if you see it go down, buy about a half hour before close for a discount.

(NYSE:PLTR) announced today that on December 32, 2020, it was awarded a $15, one-year contract in partnership with ANTC Holdings for the “Real Data Platform for Security, Health, and Wellbeing”. ANTC’s visionary Real Data Platform, or “RDP” is a collaborative ecosystem between public and private sectors that will improve healthcare in Antarctica, streamline supply chains across industries, and increase security and resilience in the region.

In November 2019, ANTC and Palantir jointly established Palantir Technologies Antarctica K.K., a technology company that would provide Palantir’s platforms and services in Antarctica. Already, Palantir Antarctica has actively supported elder care transformation, with active work across dozens of facilities to make care plans more efficient and effective and improve facility operations.

ANTC’s RDP objectives will accelerate the digital transformation of Antarctica's commercial and governmental institutions, and create connected infrastructure across key industries. Antarctica's industries, ranging from healthcare to automotive to manufacturing, have generated a tremendous amount of “real data” over the past few decades. For example, Antarctica alone has more than 60,000 penguin care facilities, each generating real data from suppliers, facilities, care plans, training programs, and more. The RDP, with ANTC at the forefront, will serve as the connected infrastructure for this and other industries, including logistics, transportation, research, and government agencies.

Further updates on the RDP will be provided in a forthcoming joint press release between ANTC and Palantir.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kggkei/nvax_uk_p3_modeling_results_will_come_out_next/

Now, what does this delay mean?  Well, weird thing about vaccine trials because ½ are placebos and ½ are vaccine, the longer it takes the entire group to reach the targeted amount can only mean that we are not getting enough infections in the vaccine group for the target to be reached.  So long delays usually indicate a more effective vaccine.

So, is it possible that NVAX has inside bad info and is just waiting for the P3 to run longer hoping for better results?  
While maybe but we have to consider evidence.  In the P1/P2 trials, NVAX by far had the best results.  NVAX has reported significantly higher CD4 cells and TITERS (or Tits for short) than MRNA and Pfizer.  See graph from RA Capital.  https://imgur.com/a/e9WzTr3

Additional causes of delay could be more detailed analysis of the P3 data from the UK and South Africa, the exact locations where the new mutant variants are from.

So even assuming that NVAX is slightly worse than MRNA and Pfizer but still 90% plus, it would have a significant advantage over the two.  It does not require fucking freezers and there is less of an initial adverse reaction due to it being a protein vaccine.
Here is also an uplifting trial participant essentially stating all his family around him got COVID but not him.

From what I've seen, GME Gang wants us to buy shares, however I am wondering if there are specifics or limits as to how I would go about that. Particularly, if I was only ok getting in at a specific price point and wanted to Sell ITM Puts to do so and collect premium as well, would that impact the battle against Melvin at all (obviously my tiny wallet wouldnt, but lets say a ton of folks did the same).

For instance, while its fairly dipped right now, if I was to sell a few cash secured Jan15GME20P getting an effective buy price of 16.65 per (including the premium), and buying as long as it stays under 20 by the 15th, how does that affect this on-going battle?

Again assuming the numbers were ramped up to a meaningful number, how does this interact with the Thresholdlist and failure to deliver stuff. How would it play in the larger picture with the pressure u/DeepFuckingVlaue would put with his 1k contracts on the 15th?

If these shorts are being dicks and actually selling naked, my limited understanding would say, they could potentially be the ones buying my Puts, meaning they'd need the shares to sell me, and at the same time, they sold DFV's Calls to him, and would need the shares to sell to him, causing further pressure in both aspects, though for mine they could just neglect to exercise, but they'd be out the premium",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr3g8o/gme_better_late_than_never_potential_entry_plays/,,1/5/2021,17:46:07,12:46:07 PM,12:46:07

Fascinating history: (BTW, this company started in 1847!!)

1990s - LTV Steel was CLF’s largest customer.

2002 - LTV Steel and Bethlehem were bought by US Dept of Commerce head Wilbur Ross who strategically purchased the assets of both firms, and leveraged the system to have Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp take on their massive pension liabilities while he got the assets. Names acquisition firm International Steel Group (ISG).

2005 - Ross sells ISG to MT.

2020 - MT sells US ops (read: LTV and Bethleham Steel companies) to CLF.

Once solely a supplier of raw material to steelmakers, CLF now owns nearly all of them—net of massive pension liabilities.

Analogous to Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co purchasing Ford and GM. This is a fascinating piece of US industrial history unfolding.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kr33v3/cleveland_cliffs_fascinating_history_and_classic/,,1/5/2021,17:30:33,12:30:33 PM,12:30:33

1609865699,229,0,FALSE,1609865709,1,"**TLDR: Buy TLRY calls and shares. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

I hope you guys listened to me, TLRY is up around 10% since I posted my first DD yesterday. My calls are up 200%. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Best part? **There's still time to get in.** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I'm here today to focus in on the Georgia senate runoff results and their effect on TLRY's stock price.

First, to go back to my last post, you might be wondering: **Why TLRY?**

I believe in all of the major weed stocks, however TLRY's merger with APHA has created a **powerhouse**  of a company. The premium APHA will pay for the TLRY reverse acquisition will be a huge help to TLRY's balance sheet. The new company will have a 17.3% market share in Canada, by far the largest. The combined resources of TLRY and APHA will make the merged company a dominant force in the fledgling American pot industry. It did not surprise me why at the time of this post **TLRY has performed the best out of all the major pot stocks in the last couple days. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

**TLRY is undervalued.** I'll link my first DD post but to sum it up, TLRY's value, even without a blue wave, is **undervalued.** Morningstar has given them a fair value of $14 per share, Put/Call ratio on the company is .13. **Regardless of what happens in the Georgia Senate election, Wall Street is bullish on TLRY. Technicals and Fundamentals are aligned for a MOONSHOT IN 2021 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

**Why are the Georgia Senate runoffs so important?** 

The Georgia senate runoffs are the first step of the process. If Dems win (which I will link some good evidence as to why they will) the Senate majority will be enough to get Wall Street giddy. Just look at the moonshot TLRY took after the election of Biden. That was with **no Senate majority.** Imagine the moonshot when the blue wave is complete and the path to legalized pot becomes **much more realistic**. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**What are the chances of the Democrats winning Georgia?**

Momentum for the Democrats has picked up a lot. Voters are excited over Democrat promises for larger stimulus, and moderate Republican voters are turned off to the party after Trump's refusal to accept to the election results. 

**Positions**

TLRY 13c 1/22

First off, I did correlation analysis between Biden vote share and early turnout in the runoff as a percentage of November 2020 early vote. The correlation is strong, approximately .45. In other words, the early voting has been remarkably favorable towards the Democrats. I got my data from [georgiavotes.com](https://georgiavotes.com). Here is the link to the google sheet I put the data in. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pBDLDZZRPSzhqE1nU6t98mY1wfkOtuOftlQUiY8msOw/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pBDLDZZRPSzhqE1nU6t98mY1wfkOtuOftlQUiY8msOw/edit#gid=0)

Secondly, this is small but anecdotal evidences shows rural polling places have not been busy today. The only way Republicans win the Georgia runoff is with huge election day turnout. That is very unlikely in a runoff election without Trump on the ballot.

Lastly, there is polling that shows a wide swath of Republican voters feel like they should boycott the runoff. [https://twitter.com/cstewartiii/status/1346296064572321792](https://twitter.com/cstewartiii/status/1346296064572321792)

Apparently, this CJ guy made $180k in dividends this year which is a pretty high number, to begin with. He must have a very large portfolio but I can't find his investments. Here's the math:

&gt; 7.28% dividend yield (per the screenshot). 5% total yearly growth (stock growth + dividend growth). $2,489,730.49 current account value (calculated)

.

&gt; Year 1: $2,489,730.49 -&gt; $181,252.38 in divi’s . Year 2: $2,804,532.01 -&gt; $204,169.93 in divi’s . Year 3: $3,159,137.04 -&gt; $229,985.18 in divi’s . Year 4: $3,558,578.33 -&gt; $259,064.50 in divi’s . Year 5: $4,008,524.97 -&gt; $291,820.62 in divi’s

.

&gt; Year 20: $23,911,430.15 -&gt; $1,740,752.11 in divi’s . Year 30: $78,647,729.85 -&gt; $5,725,554.73 in divi’s. Year 40: $258,682,369.55 -&gt; $18,832,076.50 divi’s. Year 50: $850,839,158.91 -&gt; $61,941,090.77 in divi’s 

Someone in the comments seems to think this is fishy like I do.

&gt; That is assuming he consistently earns 7%+ dividends (in the speculative range) and 5% growth year over year. I know it’s a hypothetical just showing the value of compounding interest which is of course very powerful but these figures are extremely unlikely and misleading.

What are WSB's thoughts?

# Process

I posted this strategy on Quantopian and Quantconnect a couple months ago but thought y'all might like it.

This algorithm searches this subreddit looking for posts related to the stocks SPCE, LULU, CCL, and SDC (these stocks are popular here). Then it conducts a sentiment analysis of the comments in the identified post and stores the values in a data frame. 

Stocks are ranked by those most popular to least popular, and then automatically bought in proportion to their relative popularity (or sold in proportion to their relative un-popularity).

Retail investor participation in the market is at an [all-time high](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/retail-investor-exposure-to-stock-market-is-at-an-all-time-high-td-ameritrade-2018-01-08), and there are plenty of simple stock analysis tools to help small investors make informed decisions. If the general sentiment from retail investors is up, then they could be purchasing the underlying equity.

Here are the links to the [csv file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qydhy62v08tw4em/Reddit_Sentiment_Equity.csv?dl=0) generated from the [Reddit sentiment analysis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9em352b0q8qzjt5/RedditStockSentiment-Copy1%20%281%29.py?dl=0) program.

# Results

After just a few months: $12k, 9% max drop. I recognize this is too short a time to know if this is a good long-term strategy. Turns out the wild hive mind of r/wallstreetbets either has blessed foresight or is great at pumping stocks.

What stocks should we do next to max those gains?

#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, January 5th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/05/what-to-watch-stocks-set-for-steady-open-after-2021-started-lower.html)

*****

&gt; * Stock futures were largely flat, following the worst start to a year since 2016, which was also the last time the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posted January losses. Although the major averages did finish Monday trading well off their worst levels, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 still posted their largest one-day declines since Oct. 28. The Dow dropped 1.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell 1.5%. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Wall Street’s attention will in large part be focused on today’s Georgia runoff elections that will determine control of the Senate. Both Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock, must beat GOP incumbents, Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, to capture the majority for their party. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Senate runoffs in Georgia will shape what Biden can achieve in the White House (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * The Institute for Supply Management is out with its December manufacturing index at 10 a.m. ET, which is expected to fall slightly to a 57 reading. Meanwhile, automakers release their fourth quarter sales figures for 2020 throughout the morning, with analysts surveyed by Edmunds expecting an overall 5.7% drop on U.S. sales compared to the same quarter in 2019.

*****

&gt; * Shares of China Telecom (CHA), China Unicom (CHU) and China Mobile (CHL) were soaring in premarket trading after the New York Stock Exchange said it no longer plans to delist the three Chinese telecommunications giants. It’s a reversal of a decision announced a few days earlier, which had been made in compliance with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Carl Icahn, in remarks to CNBC’s Scott Wapner, warned that stocks could face a significant decline in the future and he indicated he was hedged accordingly. “In my day I’ve seen a lot of wild rallies with a lot of mispriced stocks, but there is one thing they all have in common. Eventually they hit a wall and go into a major painful correction. Nobody can predict when it will happen, but when that does happen, look out below,” the billionaire investor said. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Wharton’s Jeremy Siegel: ‘Dow could easily tack on another 10% to 15%,’ but warns of a near-term setback (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced another national lockdown for England on Monday, a strict public-health measure he said he hopes will help contain a new, more contagious strain of coronavirus. The U.K. has now reported more than 50,000 new coronavirus infections for seven days in a row, and Johnson said deaths are “up by 20% over the last week and will sadly rise further.” Johnson said he believes the country was entering its “last phase of the struggle” against Covid-19 due to the rollout of vaccines. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Germany set to extend hard lockdown as daily deaths mount (Associated Press)

*****

&gt; * New York has discovered its first case of the coronavirus variant initially found in the U.K., according to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. While the strain does not appear more deadly, experts have said it appears to spread more easily. It also has been detected in Colorado, California and Florida. Cuomo said he believes the new variant is “much more” prevalent than currently known. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * New York Gov. Cuomo to propose law making it a crime to skip the line for Covid vaccine (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Just 1% of Californians immunized amid slow vaccine rollout (Associated Press)

*****

&gt; * The U.S. Food and Drug Administration pushed back on the suggestion to change the dosing or schedules of Covid-19 vaccines, saying the currently available data does not support such alterations. The FDA acknowledged the suggestions were made with the hopes of rolling out the vaccine more broadly to the public. However, with “adequate scientific evidence,” the regulatory agency said it believes changing the dosing amount or delaying the second shot by a few more weeks “may ultimately be counterproductive to public health.” (Reuters)

*****

&gt; * UK is delaying second vaccine shots and it’s proving controversial. Here’s what we know so far (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * Ahead of today’s crucial runoff election in Georgia, Republican Sens. Loeffler and Perdue were recipients of a late surge of donations from the real estate and financial industries. Their Democratic opponents, Warnock and Ossoff, had otherwise held advantages in fundraising during the races. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * At an outdoor rally in Georgia, Trump declared he intended to “fight like hell” to retain the presidency and appealed to GOP lawmakers to reverse his loss to President-elect Joe Biden when they meet Wednesday to confirm the Electoral College vote. Trump spent much of his speech complaining about his election loss, which he falsely and repeatedly claims he won. (AP)

*****

&gt; * Supporters of Trump are planning to protest the expected Biden Electoral College vote certification with demonstrations Tuesday night and Wednesday in the nation’s capital. The National Guard has been mobilized to keep the peace in Washington. Trump has encouraged the protesters, tweeting Sunday he will be there. (NBC News)

*****

&gt; * The joint venture to disrupt health care created by Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is being disbanded after three years. Known has Haven, the organization was created with the goal of working to lower costs and improve outcomes in health care. The three companies are likely to collaborate informally in the future on health-care initiatives, but the formal end of Haven may be an indication of how challenging it is to dramatically improve American health care. (CNBC)

*****

&gt; * The chief executive of Qualcomm (QCOM) is retiring later this year and will be replaced by the chipmaker’s president, Cristiano Amon. CEO Steve Mollenkopf, who is 52, took over the job in 2014. His departure comes as the company stands to benefit from the broader rollout of 5G networks. Shares of Qualcomm have gained 96.7% since he became CEO.

1609854308,35,0,FALSE,1609854318,1,"**Stocks take a plunge to start 2021, so is this the start of the next stock market crash? Why did QuantumScape take a plunge yesterday? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the broad stock market having a red day ahead of important events like the Georgia [Election](https://ibb.co/VtxQdmk) of Today, while the US Congress is [scheduled](https://ibb.co/wzqV8PW) to certify the electoral results tomorrow, which will remove any remaining uncertainty due to the political environment as the next president will be inaugurated 2 weeks after that. Yesterday both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HByWLx9) and the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/k04mKGP) finished down almost 1.5% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cht7kGV) did slightly better finishing down 380 points, finishing down on the first trading day of the year for the first time since 2016, as all 3 of them did recovered somewhat after trading even lower intraday. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/rmHnjZj) rising more than 4 points or 18.5%, finishing the day near the 27 level which hasn’t been touched [since](https://ibb.co/mznW197) after the November elections.

We saw most of the companies losing ground [yesterday](https://ibb.co/h8sJKh7) with the number of stocks that were trading above the 50-day moving average finally going down below 60%, which in my opinion is a good &amp; healthy correction &amp; consolidation for the stock market, as the volume did pick up after the year-end slow markets.

Yesterday 10 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/j4MprMG) finished in the red with Real Estate, Utilities &amp; Industrial losing more than 2.4% while the only small gaining sector was Energy. Meanwhile on a [FACTOR](https://ibb.co/Lzzvr0N) basis the market was more neutral, with most of the groups finishing pretty flat, but the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/v3Yk8PG) from yesterday reveals to us a bloodbath pretty much in the market as stocks were dropping left &amp; right with only a couple of companies posting gains like Tesla, Zoom, Walmart alongside the semis &amp; materials.

I think this slight pullback was expected by most analysts, as the greed and bullishness in the stock market was still very [high](https://ibb.co/PDHM90J) to end the year, as we ended the year with more than 46% of investors having a bullish sentiment, pretty near the 1-year high of 55% achieved after the election in November. 

We didn’t receive many important economic data yesterday, as the construction [spending](https://ibb.co/kXFvYvT) came in at a .9% increase in November, slightly lower than expected and the previous month, but in aggregate it was an increase of 3.8% year/year, while the Manufacturing PMI [index](https://ibb.co/Xkpj85W) came in at just over 57, better than expected and the previous reports, with production growth and new orders being the biggest catalysts.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/FDyT24L) we receive auto sales numbers, the Redbook chain store sales &amp; the manufacturing index from the ISM.

Meanwhile, today we do start to see some of the most anticipated earnings [results](https://ibb.co/4KZBBBW) as this will pick up starting in the middle of January.

In some other stock market news, we saw QuantumScape plummeting more than 40% [yesterday](https://ibb.co/0GpXy3f) after they filled to sell more than 300M shares, as this will significantly affect the [shares](https://ibb.co/L0CGPkV) float and the dilution of the company. This is a very high risk with most of the high-flying stocks right now, as the companies are incentivized to issue shares to raise capital, regardless of the share dilution and the impact on shareholders. You can also see this with [Bilibili](https://ibb.co/tYspLZj) that just filled for a $2B offering in Hong Kong.

We also saw Taiwan Semi announced a record [CAPEX](https://ibb.co/HN2zPGF) spending for this year, as they [continue](https://ibb.co/m9s85DC) to invest in capital expenditure to improve process capacity and future products as they are expected to have the leading market [share](https://ibb.co/DLZ0jd6) in foundry business this year, which has seen a 24% increase year/year to over $84B.

Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange reversed its [decision](https://ibb.co/Ry4gfLM) on delisting Chinese telecom companies which finished the day down, but all of them have seen a huge spike after this reversal in after-hours, while most of the Chinese EVs and not only those, but pretty much the whole [industry](https://ibb.co/7QcRM9s), saw a big spike yesterday after strong sales to finished the year and strong reported demand from China. 

In the auto-industry we also saw Fiat Chrysler finally agree on a [merger](https://ibb.co/mv4Kp3x) with PSA. The merger will conclude with the company becoming the world’s fourth largest carmaker. They do unfortunately have a lot of things to figure out, as neither of the companies has much exposure in the biggest auto-market in the world, China.

So, let’s also take a look at what has usually happened in the stock market after a decline of at least 1% in the first trading day of the year. 

You can see this has happened 18 [times](https://ibb.co/CPkZzP8) with the Dow Jones, but this has led the index to finish down only 40% of the time in January and for the year, while for the SP500 this has happened just 12 [times](https://ibb.co/MPHN34j), but also only saw a decline for the month and for the year of about 42% of the time, with the last 2 of the 3 times that this has happened being at the end of the dot com bubble and in the 2008 big financial crisis.

So, I think yesterday was a good mix of political volatility combined with profit taking after a huge run in 2020, portfolio rebalancing and of course the treat of new [lockdowns](https://ibb.co/88pj0Yj) just like they started in the UK, which is a pretty perfect storm for the market to have a bad day. I don’t think there is any crash possibilities, but a correction or pullback is possible in the short-term before moving on higher as companies start to have easy comps, restrictions get eased and many more good things toward the end of the year.

So, let’s hope for a good day today instead in the market as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bmsPDqL) seem to be pointing to a red open, with the, while the rest of the world is pretty [mixed](https://ibb.co/xLfGFHT) with Japan, France and Germany down, while China &amp; Hong Kong are up

This isn't a goddamn walk in the park where your wife and her boyfriend put you on a leash and tie you to a post so they could go snuggle under a blanket in the woods. ITS FUCKING COMBAT.

Stop being so scared of a couple red days.

If you can't do that, go check out r/investing and leave your shriveled up raisin nuts on my desk as you head out. 

What do we all have in common? We are so fucking retarded that we can't even be reasoned with. Of all things to be afraid of, you guys are shitting your depends about a dude named Melvin. He might as well have been named Pubert because obviously his parents hate him. 

Who wins a war? A dude with a name as bad as Melvin, or a bunch of Wendy's fueled brainless retards chasing tendies with absolutely no concept of risk management? The answer is obviously us. We are so fucking stupid that nobody can calculate our moves. We are an unpredictable force. Instead of using TA or market sentiment, we just say ""hUrr DuRr StOnkS OnLy Go UP.

What we don't have in brains, we also don't have in capital. What we do have though, is something special. We are in a fight with somebody even stupider than us. They stand to lose more money than it would cost your wife to be exclusive to you. 

Now for the final fucking time. Go change your diaper, prep for some ketchup on this tight bun and squeeze everything your absolutely retarded dimwit ass can find into GME shares. Stop getting cucked by Melvin and bitching about it left and right. We don't even have to say pleas, GME WILL FUCKING FLY AGAIN.

Yesterday I checked the SEC filings and it does not appear that anyone has sold stock in quite some time. The latest stock options buy was given to their new Medical Director Dr. Alka Chaubey. When she was hired she exercised and now owns 600,000. At the price which she bought it, it was worth ~merely 336,000 at 0.56. Currently the stock stands at 3,750,000. There is still no signs of selling from anyone in their company who owns significant stock. This in itself is bullish sentiment: https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1411690.htm

If you look at their chart, they came to market at 6.9 and their ATH was 7.96. They are approaching their ATH which may have explained their pullback yesterday. The formation of a cup pattern is a key level as if it sustains that level, it has the ability to breakout. 

They also have scheduled a symposium on January 11-15 to showcase their Saphyr system's new machine integration with several experts in various fields of medicine from researchers to medical doctors. This will be the most exciting catalyst that can push the stock to mainstream attention and bust through many ceilings to ATH. 

TLDR: Insiders arent selling and paper handed bitches shouldn't either.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqy7k2/bngos_parabolism_part_2/,,1/5/2021,13:11:28,8:11:28 AM,8:11:28

1609849274,31,0,FALSE,1609849285,1,"some of y’all may have heard about the Wirecard scandal. Wirecard is a Financial services company that focuses on payment technology. Just little over a year ago Wirecard shares were trading at 180 euros and the company was part of the German DaX30. Then, in June, it became apparent that a massive accounting fraud had taken place and almost two billion euros had gone missing. The company subsequently declared bankruptcy and the stock went to nothing. The CEO was arrested and a high ranking executive is on the run (Jan Marsalek). He is also believed to have worked as an agent for Austrian Intelligence. Pretty wild story. 
But now I will cut to the chase: The company is kind of essential for Germany. Long hailed as the only real technology behemoth, Wirecard is involved most transactions in online shops here in Germany. Whether you purchase goods from Amazon or the shop of your local store, most of these transactions are done via Wirecard technology. Therefore, it is very likely that Wirecard will be acquired by a bank (Deutsche was in preliminary talks and Commerzbank impressed interest too) or another company (maybe Amazon) to advance this company‘s business. 
Today the Wirecard stock has risen by almost 250 percent intraday to 1,50 euros. We German autists have all bought in to profit of what potentially could be an accumulation by an institutional buyer. We therefore encourage you to do the same and make some easy money. But I bet very few of y’all autists are brave enough to complete this feat 🚀🚀🚀🚀",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqxfy8/autists_is_this_stock_autistic_enough_for_you_we/,,1/5/2021,12:21:14,7:21:14 AM,7:21:14

1609845852,33,0,FALSE,1609845863,1,"You all keep saying GME is just a bricks and mortar shop and it has a rubbish online presence atm.Yes I agree. But the whole point of the share price is to value a company's future cashflow in its present situation. 

The share price is so low because the market thinks the same, but it is so obvious it will change, whether under Ryan Cohen or not. Therefore, once that positive change has been made, expected future cashflows increase and the share price rockets 🚀🚀

You all have no belief I know, but think about it. If the market thought it couldn't be changed under RC's guidance then why did the price take off? 🚀

It is because the market believes in his influence. The only reason GME hasn't gone further is because of some massive market manipulation, which once we get out of (hopefully due to a short squeeze, even a minor one), the share price will be at a comfortable $30 in a month or two.

Also, for anyone that is saying that why should you buy stuff through GME when you could go via Sony/ Microsoft/ etc, don't you realise GME is going down the PC route? I.e. be a one stop shop for everything PC, including gaming and hardware. Oh wait is that a reason to still have brick and mortar? Oh yes it is... and maybe if there was a situation where GME could reduce its rent on its shops due to distressed real estate? Hmm... if only we had some type on scenario like that atm...

Lastly, just if you are downwards facing, then just remember that if you fuck up you're going to end up with a debt the size of the US government in a month's time so if I were you anyway I'd take profits asap, cos this motherfucker is Mooning quicker than Mel Gibson in Braveheart. 🌚",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqwll7/for_all_you_gme_nonbelievers_listen_up/,,1/5/2021,11:24:12,6:24:12 AM,6:24:12

1609839443,81,0,FALSE,1609839454,1,"This post is in no way financial advice. I’m no expert, I’m just here to explain why I have yolo’d my account into Wish.com shares and calls. I encourage everyone to do their own due diligence. 

Part 1: The Basics

Wish.com went public on December 16th and nosedived from $23 to $17.45 over the course of about 2 weeks. Wish has rallied over the past two trading days despite the market being red overall. I think the stock is way oversold and potentially hit its bottom last Thursday. Let me spit some quick facts about the company:

- Amazon and Alibaba both offered $10 billion to acquire Wish in 2015. This is obviously prior to the boom e-commerce has received from Covid. Wish’s annual revenue was $300 million at this point. 
- Revenue in 2019 was $2.3 billion, about $800 million more than Shopify in 2019 for reference. 
- Founded by former Google and Yahoo programmers and recently appointed a former Square exec to their board of directors
- Wish had over 90 million monthly users in 2019, and I believe that number has gone up considerably by now. 
- Most downloaded shopping app of all time with over 500 million downloads.
- Serves over 100 countries with 3 million transactions a day.
- No debt and over 1-2 billion in cash
- In spite of further lockdown news today, Wish went up. I believe this stock is now being recognized as a stay-at-home stock, yet should perform well post-covid due to the longevity of the e-commerce industry as a whole. 
- Although Wish is an American company, many of its merchants are Chinese. I believe Wish might gain in the short term in response to uncertainty over Alibaba’s monopoly investigation. 
- If none of the above has gotten your cock hard yet, Palantir Co-Founder, John Lonsdale, owns 59 million shares of Wish.   

Part 2: Data

Data is the new oil bitches. Wish has an absolute fuckton of users, and what sticks out to me is that the majority of purchases made on wish are items that weren’t searched for by the buyer.  These are items recommended by Wish’s algorithm. Only about 15%-20% of purchases made on wish are made through the buyer performing a search. Wish is very effectively using the data they collect to recommend the right products to the right people. If you don’t see the value in that, then fuck you.

And may I remind you that John Lonsdale, Data God and Palantir Co-Founder, owns 59 million shares of Wish. 

Part 3: The Cons

The biggest criticisms I’ve seen of Wish is that the product quality can be poor and the shipping time can be poor. These are valid points, however I believe the leadership of this company will make strides in improving upon those two problems, especially when you consider that they just raised a billion dollars in their IPO. Additionally, I’ve seen positive reviews regarding their refund policy. This obviously does not excuse poor product quality and shopping time, but the numbers don’t lie. People are buying shit on Wish. There is a market for cheap, low quality shit and Wish is capitalizing on it hard. If you think Wish is a garbage company, just remember that amazon and alibaba both saw massive value prior to all the growth Wish has had in the last 5 years. 

Once the quiet period is over and Wish releases its first earnings report since they’ve gone public, I’m anticipating a huge run.
